<2en> a Re@@ publi@@ can strategy to counter the re@@ -@@ election of Obama 
<2en> Re@@ publi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud . 
<2en> however , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by li@@ ght@@ ning . 
<2en> indeed , Re@@ publi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade . 
<2en> one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter tur@@ n@@ -@@ out . 
<2en> in this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system . 
<2en> unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States . 
<2en> it is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult . 
<2en> this phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Re@@ publi@@ can representatives added in 26 States . 
<2en> as a result , 1@@ 80 bi@@ lls restric@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone . 
<2en> the new election laws require voters to show a p@@ hoto I@@ D card and proof of US citizenship . 
<2en> furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , inv@@ ali@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record . 
<2en> before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a p@@ hoto I@@ D card . 
<2en> Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement . 
<2en> in 2008 , the Su@@ pre@@ me Court of the United States up@@ held the constitu@@ tion@@ ality of the Indi@@ ana law . 
<2en> the Re@@ publi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States . 
<2en> over the past two years , they spon@@ sor@@ ed bi@@ lls in 34 States to force voters to show a p@@ hoto I@@ D card . 
<2en> it is important to note that , unlike Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c , American citizens do not have a universal I@@ D card such as the health insurance card . 
<2en> in fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not poss@@ ess a p@@ hoto I@@ D card issued by a government agency of their State . 
<2en> in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification . 
<2en> and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card . 
<2en> the new restrictions disproportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes . 
<2en> in fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those ear@@ ning less than $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required p@@ hoto I@@ D card . 
<2en> and that 's not all . 
<2en> students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the p@@ hoto I@@ D card issued by their institution . 
<2en> on the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hun@@ ting club members , who vote more Re@@ publi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote . 
<2en> prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote . 
<2en> Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement . 
<2en> since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens . 
<2en> these measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ pan@@ ic vote . 
<2en> however , it appears that two out of three His@@ pan@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party . 
<2en> what is more , in 2011 Re@@ publi@@ can legisla@@ tors spon@@ sor@@ ed laws abol@@ ishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States . 
<2en> in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wis@@ hing to register . 
<2en> these restrictions are not without consequence . 
<2en> for example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to regis@@ tering around 10 million citizens . 
<2en> however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 . 
<2en> in addition , Re@@ publi@@ can legisla@@ tors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period . 
<2en> for example , during the 2008 general election in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , 33 % of early voters were Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State . 
<2en> the same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics . 
<2en> these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early . 
<2en> on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters . 
<2en> of course , Democratic legisla@@ tors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restric@@ ting voter registration . 
<2en> several bi@@ lls were blocked by ve@@ to@@ es of Democratic gover@@ nor@@ s . 
<2en> the United States At@@ tor@@ ney General interven@@ ed to suspen@@ d the most controversial laws . 
<2en> they were able to parti@@ ally limit the damage . 
<2en> for example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a p@@ hoto I@@ D card . 
<2en> however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 . 
<2en> Democratic cri@@ tics denoun@@ ce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influen@@ cing the 2012 results in key States . 
<2en> a 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral col@@ lege to win the Presidency . 
<2en> it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections . 
<2en> but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n@@ -@@ out . 
<2en> in this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system . 
<2en> pro@@ state cancer scre@@ ening : take the test or not ? 
<2en> indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions . 
<2en> enough to make already reluc@@ tant men hesi@@ tate to take scre@@ ening tests . 
<2en> take the test or not ? 
<2en> we asked two speci@@ alists for their opinion . 
<2en> in studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpre@@ t the data and make firm recommendations . 
<2en> another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortali@@ ty between patients who were scre@@ en@@ ed and those who were not . 
<2en> this study also showed , with a follow@@ -@@ up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for me@@ ta@@ sta@@ ses to occur in the absence of scre@@ ening . 
<2en> I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer . 
<2en> Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk . 
<2en> the key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detec@@ ted . 
<2en> there are aggressive can@@ cers and others that are ind@@ ol@@ ent . 
<2en> the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily tre@@ ating pro@@ state can@@ cers that are not long@@ -@@ term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease . 
<2en> today , many men in whom cancer has been detec@@ ted will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening . 
<2en> active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment . 
<2en> more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated . 
<2en> therefore I recommend taking the test . 
<2en> but the important thing is to have a discussion with your doc@@ tor to determine whether or not to take it . 
<2en> in collaboration with the Soci@@ été internationale d '@@ U@@ ro@@ lo@@ gie [ SI@@ U ] , M@@ ov@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and con@@ s of the P@@ SA test . 
<2en> you can down@@ load the document ( in English for the time being , a [ French ] translation will be available shortly ) at this address : h@@ tt@@ p : / / ca@@ .@@ mo@@ v@@ ember@@ .com / f@@ r / men@@ s@@ -@@ health / pro@@ sta@@ te@@ -@@ can@@ cer@@ -@@ scre@@ ening 
<2en> preventing the disease 
<2en> unfortunately , there is no mira@@ cle reci@@ pe for preventing cancer . 
<2en> despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living hab@@ its remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it . 
<2en> it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercis@@ ed enough , 30 % of can@@ cers could be prevented . 
<2en> " if no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says An@@ dré Be@@ au@@ lieu , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Can@@ adi@@ an Can@@ cer Soci@@ ety . 
<2en> on the other hand , it is estimated that rou@@ ghly 10 % of can@@ cers are h@@ ere@@ di@@ tary . 
<2en> some are also completely un@@ explained . 
<2en> for the Can@@ adi@@ an Can@@ cer Soci@@ ety , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers . 
<2en> cigarettes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases . 
<2en> it is also a risk factor for a number of others . 
<2en> this massi@@ vely dama@@ ges people 's health . 
<2en> " even today , there are 1.@@ 5 million smo@@ kers in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c " de@@ pl@@ ores spo@@ k@@ esper@@ son An@@ dré Be@@ au@@ lieu . 
<2en> encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer dro@@ ps by half . 
<2en> weight 
<2en> over@@ weight and ob@@ es@@ ity are also condu@@ ci@@ ve to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the S@@ C@@ C . 
<2en> they can increase the risks of cancer of the bre@@ ast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gu@@ s , pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us . 
<2en> " research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protec@@ ts against col@@ on cancer " it is also said . 
<2en> di@@ et 
<2en> the organisation also recommen@@ ds limiting your consumption of red meat . 
<2en> in large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal cancer . 
<2en> likewise , so do cu@@ red meat products , and these should be avoided . 
<2en> the conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens . 
<2en> " they can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained . 
<2en> vi@@ ta@@ min@@ s 
<2en> in recent years , a number of scientists have stu@@ died the links between vi@@ tam@@ in supple@@ ments and cancer . 
<2en> for the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive . 
<2en> studies on vi@@ tam@@ in E are contradic@@ tory , according to the S@@ C@@ C . 
<2en> while one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase . 
<2en> also the effect of vi@@ tam@@ in D on cancer is not clear . 
<2en> in addition , Mr Be@@ au@@ lieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doc@@ tor . 
<2en> " taking a scre@@ ening test do@@ es@@ n 't give you cancer . " 
<2en> the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed 
<2en> the announcement of the probable dis@@ co@@ very of the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a sti@@ r last summer , and with good reason . 
<2en> indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ verse , no less . 
<2en> also it is the last par@@ ticle whose existence is predic@@ ted by the Standar@@ d Mo@@ del - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cally . 
<2en> but for physi@@ cis@@ ts , it is still not completely sure that it really is the H@@ ig@@ gs . 
<2en> we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authenti@@ c par@@ ticle , and greatly res@@ emb@@ les the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son predic@@ ted by the Standar@@ d Mo@@ del . 
<2en> in addition , new data un@@ vei@@ led this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure . 
<2en> but let 's suppose that it really is the H@@ ig@@ gs , since the chances of being mis@@ taken seem sli@@ m , and see what it is . 
<2en> in our world , there is a fa@@ tally un@@ avoi@@ dable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time . 
<2en> there 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go ma@@ d . 
<2en> however , even though par@@ ticle physi@@ cs is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pau@@ li exclusion principle , which states that two par@@ ticles cannot occu@@ py the same space at the same time if they are in the same " qu@@ an@@ tum state " - this " state " consis@@ ting rou@@ ghly of certain of their characteristics . 
<2en> based on this , physi@@ cis@@ ts classi@@ fy par@@ ticles into two categories . 
<2en> in one cor@@ ner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who wis@@ ely obe@@ y the Pau@@ li principle . 
<2en> while l@@ ur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a na@@ st@@ y band of an@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time . 
<2en> these bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and " force par@@ ticles " by which the great forces of nature are propa@@ ga@@ ted and to which the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son may be some@@ how related . 
<2en> these bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such ex@@ o@@ tic bu@@ gs as you might think . 
<2en> in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordin@@ arily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the pho@@ ton , or the " light par@@ ticle " which is the " mes@@ sen@@ ger " of the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic force . 
<2en> when , in fact , a par@@ ticle having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this " distur@@ bs " the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic field in this specific place , rather like a pe@@ b@@ ble thro@@ wn in a pon@@ d . 
<2en> this " distur@@ b@@ ance " produ@@ ces an elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic wave ( of light , infr@@ ared , ultra@@ vio@@ let etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a pho@@ ton - and thus one of the " force carri@@ er " bo@@ sons . 
<2en> more stable field 
<2en> the same applies to the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the H@@ ig@@ gs field , which must be " distur@@ bed " for the bo@@ son to appear . 
<2en> now , this H@@ ig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic field ; to ex@@ cite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a fro@@ zen pon@@ d which would need a very large ro@@ ck to w@@ r@@ ink@@ le the surface . 
<2en> which is why a huge par@@ ticle acceler@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 2@@ 7@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels . 
<2en> the analo@@ gy with the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic field is again useful for expla@@ ining the relationship between the H@@ ig@@ gs and mass . 
<2en> in fact not all par@@ ticles , or all materials , inter@@ act with the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ gne@@ tic field . 
<2en> some , such as ma@@ gne@@ ts , do so , but others don 't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fri@@ dge . 
<2en> and likewise , not all par@@ ticles inter@@ act with the H@@ ig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the pho@@ ton ) do not . 
<2en> now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? asks Ms Pla@@ mon@@ don . 
<2en> for science , it serves to check the vali@@ dity of the Standar@@ d Mo@@ del ( S@@ M ) , and also allows physi@@ ci@@ ans to examine any discrepan@@ cies between the observations and predic@@ tions of the S@@ M . 
<2en> a number of people , moreover , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sli@@ gh@@ test difference could open a door to a " new physi@@ cs " and plu@@ g certain hol@@ es in the Mo@@ del . 
<2en> this , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for grav@@ ity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dar@@ k matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Uni@@ verse ( re@@ -@@ o@@ ops ! ) . 
<2en> but to date no such discrepan@@ cies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N . 
<2en> repercussions 
<2en> the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predic@@ t , but it would be wrong to assume that there won 't be any . 
<2en> remember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pion@@ e@@ ers of the la@@ ser at Bel@@ l L@@ abor@@ atori@@ es did not suspec@@ t the revolution that would be trig@@ ger@@ ed by their work . 
<2en> they had an in@@ kl@@ ing of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest . 
<2en> in fact , the late Wil@@ lar@@ d Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at Bel@@ l Lab@@ s , where the la@@ ser was inven@@ ted in 19@@ 60 , and who himself developed the first continuous la@@ ser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 196@@ 2 - told us that initially the la@@ ser was rather seen as a " la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get . " 
<2en> just imagine ... 
<2en> and then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that surro@@ unds research . 
<2en> for example , the same Wil@@ lar@@ d Bo@@ yle developed a small light sens@@ or in 196@@ 9 , during his work in op@@ tics . 
<2en> this sens@@ or , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital ca@@ mer@@ as worldwide , and ear@@ ned him the Nobel physi@@ cs pri@@ ze in 2009 . 
<2en> this does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily trans@@ form our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ... 
<2en> pal@@ lia@@ tive care - The best way to die ... Le De@@ voir 
<2en> with its D@@ ying with Di@@ gn@@ ity Commission , Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life . 
<2en> the debate is due to resu@@ me shortly as a bill is being prepared . 
<2en> however , in this vital area , much remains to be done . 
<2en> Le De@@ voir attemp@@ ted to look more closely . 
<2en> just a few weeks ago Mr L@@ . lived alone in his Mon@@ té@@ ré@@ gie a@@ partment . 
<2en> the f@@ ester@@ ing pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two@@ -@@ year res@@ pi@@ te . 
<2en> " they gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emo@@ tions , lying in his bed at the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ lia@@ tive care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day . 
<2en> " but it 's still a sho@@ ck , you can never be prepared for it " he ad@@ ds . 
<2en> the disease is doing its work : huge weak@@ ness which preven@@ ts him going to the to@@ i@@ let alone , and even e@@ ating alone . 
<2en> sitting in front of an appe@@ tising l@@ unch , he consen@@ ts to being helped to eat , resi@@ g@@ ned . 
<2en> courage@@ ous , he even man@@ ages to s@@ mi@@ le , talks to the stran@@ gers bus@@ tling around him , bringing him his medi@@ cation , offering him a b@@ ath . 
<2en> the courage of ordinary death . 
<2en> " what I want most is to be cu@@ red of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea , it 's humili@@ ating " he confi@@ ded . 
<2en> a few hours later , the team found a cure for this ill@@ ness . 
<2en> " during our lives , we learn that a man pis@@ ses standing up , " says P@@ ier@@ re Bro@@ deur , psych@@ olog@@ ist at the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home . 
<2en> regres@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humili@@ ation . 
<2en> " it depends on the person 's ability " to accept the regres@@ sion , he says . 
<2en> because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ lia@@ tive care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regres@@ sion . 
<2en> patients at the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ lia@@ tive care home all suffer from cancer . 
<2en> they have a maximum life expec@@ tan@@ cy of three months . 
<2en> at this stage , the team of doctors and n@@ ur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so@@ -@@ called " cu@@ ra@@ tive " care . 
<2en> for Mrs A@@ . , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " consci@@ ous and suff@@ oca@@ ting . " 
<2en> but the disease has made me dis@@ cover my children . 
<2en> " I have fine children " she ad@@ ds . 
<2en> " I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a ma@@ sk put on to help her bre@@ a@@ the . 
<2en> she looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy . 
<2en> at Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volun@@ te@@ ers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with fe@@ eding . 
<2en> this is pal@@ lia@@ tive care , given when there is nothing else that can be done . 
<2en> to make death more comfor@@ table . 
<2en> in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c , there are pal@@ lia@@ tive care be@@ ds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabitants . 
<2en> this is very few when we know that we will all die one day . 
<2en> here , life continues under the best possible conditions , expla@@ ins D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home . 
<2en> whether at a physical com@@ fort , emo@@ tional or spir@@ itual level . 
<2en> a person who is dying will accept being helped to drin@@ k bran@@ dy or P@@ ep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ p@@ ple . 
<2en> di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar . 
<2en> and death is part of everyday life . 
<2en> yesterday evening , a be@@ er was served to Mr X , who died during the night . 
<2en> this morning , it is his son who will finish the be@@ er at the fe@@ et of the de@@ ce@@ ased . 
<2en> " we help relatives as much as patients " says Na@@ th@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of C@@ are . 
<2en> at the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are ali@@ ke . 
<2en> along with a 9@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old man who is sa@@ v@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly we@@ dged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ ast@@ s are dr@@ un@@ k in his honour , a 3@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ young man is dying tra@@ gi@@ cally , surro@@ unded by his parents , his wi@@ fe and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive . 
<2en> " for six months , there have always been three to five be@@ ds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a concerned D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel . 
<2en> 53 % of patients ad@@ mitted to the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital . 
<2en> lack of access to pal@@ lia@@ tive care 
<2en> it is said that 77 % of Can@@ adi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ lia@@ tive care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the termin@@ al stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home . 
<2en> and a number of organisations , such as the Vi@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ lia@@ tive C@@ are Soci@@ ety in Gre@@ ater Mon@@ tre@@ al , speci@@ alise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients . 
<2en> it is precisely this large gap in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c health care which has made a number of pal@@ lia@@ tive care physi@@ ci@@ ans fear the adoption of a law on eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assis@@ ted sui@@ cide . 
<2en> since October , a manif@@ esto , signed by pal@@ lia@@ tive care lu@@ min@@ aries including D@@ r Bal@@ four Mo@@ un@@ t and D@@ r Ber@@ n@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circu@@ lating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative . 
<2en> according to D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ lia@@ tive care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a . 
<2en> recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering . 
<2en> I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care . 
<2en> and at the same time , some on@@ colo@@ gis@@ ts work re@@ l@@ ent@@ less@@ ly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst pro@@ gno@@ ses . 
<2en> H@@ é@@ lè@@ ne Rich@@ ard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y . 
<2en> when I announced to my on@@ colo@@ g@@ ist that I was stop@@ ping the treatment , she told me she regret@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said . 
<2en> however , she had told me I was finished ! 
<2en> no all@@ -@@ powerful care 
<2en> D@@ r Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acce@@ ded to their request after they have been relie@@ ved of their pain by a pal@@ lia@@ tive care team . 
<2en> but it must be said that pal@@ lia@@ tive care is not absolutely all@@ -@@ powerful in the treatment of pain . 
<2en> according to El@@ sie Mon@@ ere@@ au , Pal@@ lia@@ tive C@@ are Director with the Pal@@ lia@@ tive C@@ are Soci@@ ety in Gre@@ ater Mon@@ tre@@ al , patients are resis@@ tant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases . 
<2en> at the very end of life , physi@@ ci@@ ans then often resort to pal@@ lia@@ tive se@@ dation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sle@@ ep until the time of death , either spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally or perman@@ ently . 
<2en> we can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their suffering . 
<2en> increasingly , an un@@ relie@@ ved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ lia@@ tive se@@ dation . 
<2en> patients who are not relie@@ ved always say the same thing : " I want to die . " 
<2en> but this does not necessarily mean " I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me , " it means " I want to be relie@@ ved . " 
<2en> this report was made possible thanks to a journalis@@ m a@@ ward from the Canada health research institu@@ tes . 
<2en> widespread real esta@@ te scand@@ als in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c 
<2en> day after day high@@ way officials , building contrac@@ tors , political party fun@@ d@@ -@@ rais@@ ers and Italian ma@@ fia speci@@ alists tell what they know of a formi@@ dable " system , " comb@@ ining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade uni@@ on@@ ists and organised crime . 
<2en> an " industry " which has cost Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c taxpayers de@@ ar@@ ly , especially in the 199@@ 0s and 200@@ 0s . 
<2en> " it is curi@@ ous how the system is cru@@ m@@ bling since we took drasti@@ c measures " says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ir@@ oni@@ cally , a Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c politici@@ an and former Mon@@ tre@@ al Chi@@ ef of Poli@@ ce . 
<2en> it was through him that the scandal bro@@ ke in 2011 , in an in@@ -@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Char@@ est , had consen@@ ted only reluc@@ tan@@ tly . 
<2en> the " Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , under@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials . 
<2en> " since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone repor@@ tedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people cur@@ bing their inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts to get a share ! 
<2en> the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission " has already brought down two may@@ ors " he ad@@ ds , hoping that it will succeed in " reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individuals . " 
<2en> a permanent anti@@ -@@ corruption unit , created in 2011 
<2en> the Per@@ man@@ ent Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption Un@@ it , created in 2011 , is also cou@@ ple@@ d with its army of government analy@@ sts , investig@@ ators , and audi@@ tors . 
<2en> plus the " Mar@@ te@@ au squ@@ ad " poli@@ c@@ emen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Mon@@ tre@@ al " se@@ wer car@@ tel " to soft pe@@ dal on the inflation of contracts ... 
<2en> in recent weeks , it has conducted a series of se@@ ar@@ ches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municip@@ al politicians , such as Fran@@ k Z@@ am@@ p@@ ino and Rich@@ ard Mar@@ co@@ tte , May@@ or of a sub@@ urban town . 
<2en> next on the list is apparently G@@ illes Va@@ il@@ lan@@ court , who has just resi@@ g@@ ned from his post as May@@ or of L@@ aval , third largest city in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c . 
<2en> he is suspec@@ ted of poc@@ ke@@ ting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts . 
<2en> others formally accused are Mon@@ tre@@ al high@@ way engine@@ ers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ curso and L@@ ino Z@@ ambi@@ to . 
<2en> the latter caused a sen@@ sation by expla@@ ining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts " system " to the commission . 
<2en> he himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Mon@@ tre@@ al to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the ma@@ fia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , May@@ or G@@ ér@@ al@@ d Tre@@ m@@ bla@@ y 's party . 
<2en> Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Can@@ adi@@ an dollars ( rou@@ ghly 6@@ 8@@ ,000 euros ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the Liberals then in power . 
<2en> he also ad@@ mitted having organised an illegal fun@@ dra@@ iser for former Liberal De@@ pu@@ ty@@ -@@ Prime Minister , Na@@ th@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au . 
<2en> se@@ wer contracts with inf@@ lated costs 
<2en> in Mon@@ tre@@ al , the corruption " system " ran smoo@@ thly . 
<2en> G@@ illes S@@ ur@@ prenant , former public works engine@@ er , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gif@@ ts , invi@@ tations to tri@@ ps , gol@@ f tour@@ na@@ ments , resta@@ ur@@ ants , ho@@ c@@ key mat@@ ches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he inf@@ lated the costs . 
<2en> other high@@ way officials ad@@ mitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by inf@@ lating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false ad@@ d@@ -@@ ons . 
<2en> then an organiser of the May@@ or 's party , Martin D@@ um@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ m@@ bla@@ y of having deliber@@ ately closed his eyes to a parallel budget fe@@ eding his co@@ ff@@ ers with dir@@ ty money . 
<2en> following these revel@@ ations , Mr Tre@@ m@@ bla@@ y resi@@ g@@ ned in early November , pl@@ ung@@ ing Mon@@ tre@@ al into a major crisis . 
<2en> Chan@@ tal Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Mon@@ tre@@ al to raise the alar@@ m . 
<2en> mayor of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re@@ -@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she pro@@ tested in 2010 against the sale of municip@@ al land b@@ ought for 5 million dollars and resol@@ d for ... 1.@@ 6 million to develop@@ ers , at the hei@@ ght of the real esta@@ te bo@@ om . 
<2en> 70 % dir@@ ty money in election campaigns 
<2en> on the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thre@@ ad in order to find out how the system - in@@ fil@@ tra@@ ted by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pr@@ its . " 
<2en> the process , she says , is " painful but positive . " 
<2en> the wo@@ und is being clean@@ ed , but Mon@@ tre@@ al would need its own investiga@@ tive unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these question@@ able practices . 
<2en> how to clean house . 
<2en> properly . 
<2en> Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that " officials sto@@ le hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially concerned about the role of " elected people aware of the scheme , " when they were not up to their ne@@ cks in the s@@ ca@@ m ! 
<2en> estima@@ ting the share of dir@@ ty money in the financing of election campaigns in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a p@@ ale reflection of reality . " 
<2en> the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c government proposes to limit don@@ ations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dir@@ ty money in politics . " 
<2en> he advo@@ cates a complete over@@ hau@@ l of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : " we can 't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to re@@ build the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . " 
<2en> although this story tar@@ nis@@ hes the international image of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c and Mon@@ tre@@ al , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au inv@@ ites anyone lau@@ gh@@ ing to look in their own back@@ y@@ ard ... 
<2en> " P@@ S@@ G is not F@@ C Barcelona ! " 
<2en> this seas@@ on , you have taken on a new sta@@ ture with P@@ S@@ G . 
<2en> how do you explain this progres@@ sion ? 
<2en> it can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of P@@ S@@ G . 
<2en> some great players have arrived . 
<2en> every day I 'm making progress alongside them . 
<2en> the technical staff has also brought me a lot . 
<2en> day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play . 
<2en> and , in a match , it 's easier . 
<2en> everything moves very fast in football . 
<2en> but I don 't get worked up . 
<2en> from my de@@ but at the C@@ la@@ i@@ re@@ fon@@ taine IN@@ F pre@@ -@@ training centre to my transfer to Sain@@ t@@ -@@ Eti@@ enne , I 've always moved step by step . 
<2en> so you benefit from the competition brought in by Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti ... 
<2en> this summer 's recru@@ its are used to playing mat@@ ches at a high level . 
<2en> they also know that every training session is crucial . 
<2en> which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best . 
<2en> on the other hand , Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti gives me a lot as regards my position . 
<2en> he 's supported by de@@ pu@@ ties like Clau@@ de Ma@@ k@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me . 
<2en> is An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti the man for the job ? 
<2en> definitely . 
<2en> An@@ cel@@ o@@ tti ins@@ p@@ ires respect among all the experts . 
<2en> today he has no equal in Li@@ gue 1 , and he 's one of the best co@@ aches in Europe . 
<2en> he has mass@@ es of experience and has won many ti@@ t@@ les with top clubs . 
<2en> he 's worked with great players . 
<2en> I think he will bring more ti@@ t@@ les to Paris . 
<2en> in January , I had an encouraging discussion with him . 
<2en> I was just coming back from a series of injur@@ ies . 
<2en> the confidence he gives me also expla@@ ins my performance . 
<2en> what importance do you attach to the first part of the seas@@ on for P@@ S@@ G ? 
<2en> in Li@@ gue 1 , L@@ y@@ on over@@ took us at the top . 
<2en> but we 're waiting on the si@@ delines . 
<2en> one of our main goals is the Cha@@ mpi@@ ons Lea@@ gue : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way . 
<2en> what is the club 's goal in this competition ? 
<2en> we 'll try to go as far as possible . 
<2en> from now on , anything can happen . 
<2en> but we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams . 
<2en> first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Por@@ to , to have home advantage in the last 16 match . 
<2en> can P@@ S@@ G become a top European club in the short term ? 
<2en> it already has the budget ... 
<2en> to become a top European club , Paris needs to win ti@@ t@@ les and keep it up over time . 
<2en> today , this is@@ n 't the case . 
<2en> financi@@ ally , P@@ S@@ G has the means to make it happen . 
<2en> in Li@@ gue 1 , would not win@@ ning the title , like last seas@@ on , be a big failure ? 
<2en> definitely , it would be a major disappointment . 
<2en> this year , we 're really committed to win@@ ning the cham@@ pion@@ ship . 
<2en> we wer@@ en 't far away last seas@@ on . 
<2en> in May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first . 
<2en> it was a terri@@ fic seas@@ on . 
<2en> we finished with 79 points . 
<2en> normally , 79 points is good enough to be top ... 
<2en> but another team , Mon@@ t@@ pel@@ lier , had an even more fanta@@ stic seas@@ on . 
<2en> I think this is the year . 
<2en> even if big teams like Mar@@ se@@ ille , L@@ y@@ on and Bor@@ de@@ aux are compe@@ ting for the title , I think we have the weapons to win . 
<2en> do you think the media expect too much of P@@ S@@ G ? 
<2en> it 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have . 
<2en> we totally accept it . 
<2en> after we won 4@@ -@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustra@@ ting . 
<2en> you wonder what more people expect . 
<2en> you 're never going to win 4@@ -@@ 0 every weekend . 
<2en> we 're not F@@ C Barcelona ! 
<2en> we 're trying to implement a game project . 
<2en> it takes time to build a team . 
<2en> the Cha@@ mpi@@ ons Lea@@ gue proved we could hold our own . 
<2en> look at Man@@ ch@@ ester City who , for two seas@@ ons , have failed to quali@@ fy for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts ! 
<2en> based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the win@@ ter break ! 
<2en> that would be to ignore our opponents and the French Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship . 
<2en> L@@ y@@ on and Mar@@ se@@ ille , who were no good last seas@@ on , were " bo@@ os@@ ted " by the new P@@ S@@ G . 
<2en> this shows that Li@@ gue 1 is exci@@ ting . 
<2en> I hope that in May we will be able to s@@ mi@@ le in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it . 
<2en> P@@ S@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ la@@ tan I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic . 
<2en> so much so that people say there is a " Z@@ la@@ tan dependence . " 
<2en> this means I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic is very successful and scor@@ es a lot of goals . 
<2en> that 's why he came , and he 's pro@@ ving he 's the star of Li@@ gue 1 . 
<2en> he 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star . 
<2en> within the group , we respect the man and the player . 
<2en> and also he respects the men he has around him . 
<2en> what he has done is truly exceptional . 
<2en> it pus@@ hes others to raise their level of play . 
<2en> T@@ hi@@ ago Sil@@ va , who is one of the best defen@@ ders in the world , also helps everyone else progress . 
<2en> how did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ? 
<2en> a disappointment . 
<2en> I really wanted to play in this Euro . 
<2en> unfortunately , my injur@@ y prevented me from getting any game time . 
<2en> I saw some things there and came out stronger . 
<2en> today , I 'm playing well in selection mat@@ ches . 
<2en> which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the Blu@@ es . 
<2en> I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now o@@ we it to myself to have exemp@@ lary behaviour . 
<2en> what do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cham@@ ps 's first few months in charge of the Blu@@ es ? 
<2en> he has the results he wanted . 
<2en> we 're well placed in the World quali@@ fying group . 
<2en> the co@@ ach is tough , close to the players , and ins@@ p@@ ires them to win . 
<2en> like L@@ au@@ rent Blan@@ c was . 
<2en> but I don 't want to make any compar@@ isons . 
<2en> Blan@@ c had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro . 
<2en> I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cham@@ ps will take the Blu@@ es to Brazil . 
<2en> did the good draw ( 1@@ -@@ 1 ) sna@@ t@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a foun@@ ding match ? 
<2en> that match gave us confidence . 
<2en> everybody fought for everybody . 
<2en> before that sho@@ ck in Spain , I '@@ d never experienced such a match in my career . 
<2en> with B@@ it@@ co@@ in , pay and sell without banks 
<2en> the opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fe@@ es among the parties involved . 
<2en> in addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises . 
<2en> in fact , B@@ it@@ co@@ in , inven@@ ted by Sa@@ to@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ a@@ mo@@ to ( a p@@ seu@@ don@@ y@@ m ) , is both a virtual currency ( but conver@@ tible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like B@@ it@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pe@@ er file exchange . 
<2en> around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 compu@@ ters on the network . 
<2en> close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as don@@ ations or means of payment . 
<2en> the bit@@ co@@ in exchange rate , after reaching a pe@@ ak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a do@@ zen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) . 
<2en> nothing very impres@@ sive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products . 
<2en> however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual curren@@ cies published in October . 
<2en> it descri@@ bes bit@@ co@@ in as " the most successful virtual currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to conventional curren@@ cies . " 
<2en> B@@ it@@ co@@ in diff@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as ' credi@@ ts ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) . 
<2en> the social network F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok has also developed this kind of system . 
<2en> but , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges . 
<2en> with B@@ it@@ co@@ in , all no@@ des in the network are both cus@@ to@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , audi@@ tors , currency issu@@ ers , and bu@@ yers and s@@ ell@@ ers . 
<2en> how does the network operate ? 
<2en> each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e@@ -@@ mail . 
<2en> except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring an@@ ony@@ mity . 
<2en> a set of information associated with this transaction is signed elec@@ troni@@ cally by a du@@ al@@ -@@ key en@@ cry@@ ption system . 
<2en> so the network can veri@@ fy the authenti@@ city of the transaction . 
<2en> using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broad@@ cast across the entire network . 
<2en> the key step is entering the new transaction in the book . 
<2en> it pas@@ ses through the resolution of a ma@@ them@@ a@@ tical challenge issued to the compu@@ ters , and the win@@ ner , a kind of interim central ban@@ ker , will have the privi@@ lege of adding this extra line . 
<2en> this is a file has@@ hing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shor@@ ter and unique digital im@@ print . 
<2en> compu@@ ters " take " the new transaction and add a number to it , then " has@@ h " it all up . 
<2en> the goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lo@@ ts of z@@ eros at the beginning ) . 
<2en> once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one . 
<2en> the transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print . 
<2en> if a user wanted to de@@ fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an or@@ p@@ han because the two have different im@@ pr@@ ints . 
<2en> the computer that resol@@ ves the challenge w@@ ins 50 bit@@ coins . 
<2en> to avoid inflation , this a@@ ward is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 . 
<2en> the number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred milli@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ... 
<2en> the difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in compu@@ ting power . 
<2en> the life of the network has had its up@@ s and dow@@ ns . 
<2en> web@@ sites providing services for B@@ it@@ co@@ in have been atta@@ cked and bit@@ coins in deposi@@ ts stol@@ en . 
<2en> " the lo@@ opho@@ le used is not the protocol itself " says P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at re@@ assur@@ ingly , who has just launched P@@ ay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the B@@ it@@ co@@ in network . 
<2en> the ECB also highlights the possibilities of money la@@ undering using this an@@ ony@@ mous service . 
<2en> but cash also has this weak@@ ness . 
<2en> major players like Wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a refuse don@@ ations of this nature . 
<2en> others , such as the W@@ ord@@ Pres@@ s blo@@ g platform , accept them . 
<2en> recently , A@@ di Sha@@ mir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circu@@ late . 
<2en> in November , " huge s@@ ell@@ -@@ off@@ s " were launched . 
<2en> " thir@@ ty thousand dollars were ex@@ changed " welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ abu@@ l , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold . 
<2en> P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network . 
<2en> his system , P@@ ay@@ t@@ uni@@ a , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a contac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses B@@ it@@ co@@ in to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper . 
<2en> also the user man@@ ages his identity and can therefore be an@@ ony@@ mous . 
<2en> the system is easy to implement by mer@@ chan@@ ts , who do not need to inst@@ all new termin@@ als or software . 
<2en> they just need to provide an address that a phone can " photo@@ graph and recognise " says P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users . 
<2en> there is a general movement to re@@ ap@@ praise hier@@ archi@@ cal systems for more horizontal systems . 
<2en> " it will take time for B@@ it@@ co@@ in to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , " he predic@@ ts . 
<2en> the ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success . 
<2en> we got out of Afghanistan . 
<2en> what now ? 
<2en> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ ap@@ is@@ a and S@@ uro@@ bi ) . 
<2en> NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 . 
<2en> it is time for the Afghan army to resu@@ me poss@@ ession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expec@@ ting us to do everything . 
<2en> it is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists . 
<2en> and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wo@@ unded , the ma@@ im@@ ed . 
<2en> the Taliban is com@@ posed of foreign extremis@@ ts , former leaders in refu@@ ge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the So@@ vie@@ ts . 
<2en> they want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ ai@@ c , even though they have been joined by J@@ i@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts , Pak@@ istan@@ is , Ara@@ bs , Uz@@ be@@ ks , Taj@@ i@@ ks . 
<2en> toler@@ ated , sometimes assis@@ ted , by local ins@@ urgen@@ ts , the latter will no longer be so when Wes@@ ter@@ ners become more scar@@ ce . 
<2en> the depar@@ ture of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hil@@ ls of al@@ mon@@ d tre@@ es plan@@ ted with French funding , was carried out in an or@@ derly fashion . 
<2en> convo@@ ys of tru@@ cks and ar@@ mou@@ red vehicles reached K@@ abu@@ l without being atta@@ cked , over@@ flo@@ wn by he@@ li@@ cop@@ ters . 
<2en> there will be no wave of the Taliban in K@@ abu@@ l by the end of 2014 . 
<2en> circumstances have changed since their ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 1996 . 
<2en> at that time K@@ abu@@ l was empty , the country being tor@@ n apart by the strug@@ g@@ les between different fac@@ tions . 
<2en> their ta@@ ke@@ over of the country had been percei@@ ved then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety . 
<2en> Afghan@@ is paid the price of the ob@@ s@@ cur@@ anti@@ s@@ m of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda , but their situation has not improved today . 
<2en> former Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are al@@ lied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position . 
<2en> the main anti@@ -@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 . 
<2en> they became prof@@ ite@@ ers , se@@ iz@@ ing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benef@@ iting from huge American ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing contracts . 
<2en> they have become dis@@ credi@@ ted ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves . 
<2en> the people , as I heard in the country@@ side , want a Government that is not made up of th@@ iev@@ es . 
<2en> many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable . 
<2en> the young people are ti@@ red of war and its ide@@ ologi@@ es . 
<2en> they have ru@@ b@@ bed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreci@@ ated the benefits . 
<2en> rou@@ ghly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; K@@ abu@@ l now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population . 
<2en> in towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and bo@@ ys ali@@ ke . 
<2en> it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the ob@@ s@@ cur@@ anti@@ s@@ m of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders . 
<2en> all of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile ph@@ ones ; television , with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere . 
<2en> the army is now present . 
<2en> will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ? 
<2en> former comman@@ ders of the anti@@ -@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restor@@ ing provin@@ cial mili@@ ti@@ as , which will escape the central power . 
<2en> Afghanistan , land of moun@@ tains , with strong local identi@@ ties , should be able to benefit from a certain decentr@@ alisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centr@@ alised State , with strong presidential power , abol@@ ishing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 196@@ 4 Constitution . 
<2en> President Kar@@ z@@ ai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 . 
<2en> but , since the 5@@ 0s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid . 
<2en> no industries have been re@@ -@@ established , no da@@ ms are in good condition , no major irri@@ gation systems have been re@@ pa@@ i@@ red . 
<2en> everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vege@@ tables . 
<2en> the Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative . 
<2en> in a country ru@@ ined by thir@@ ty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary . 
<2en> the rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge miner@@ al wealth . 
<2en> this only added to the feeling that the Wes@@ ter@@ ners were only there to se@@ ize it . 
<2en> with no energy to process the ir@@ on ore or cop@@ per on site , or means of transport to export it across the moun@@ tains , there is no mining . 
<2en> the Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es Ay@@ na@@ k cop@@ per mine , leaving international ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist site and remain the largest employers in the province . 
<2en> one day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations . 
<2en> the depar@@ ture of French combat troops was completed on 20 November . 
<2en> the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , bo@@ ys ' high school , French De@@ partment at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ological Delegation . 
<2en> since 2009 , to try to " win hear@@ ts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconci@@ ling aid and offensive actions , a " civi@@ l@@ -@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of defence ( CI@@ M@@ IC ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NG@@ O , many community and agricultural rehabili@@ tation projects in doz@@ ens of mountain villages . 
<2en> these projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the ins@@ urgency : irri@@ gation , w@@ ells , drinking water , refor@@ esta@@ tion , fruit tre@@ es , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas . 
<2en> what will we leave as a sou@@ venir , after two billion euros of military spending ? 
<2en> a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these val@@ le@@ ys often located over 2@@ ,000 me@@ tres above sea level . 
<2en> the Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y has received doz@@ ens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in K@@ ap@@ is@@ a province . 
<2en> to be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ pris@@ ing led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them . 
<2en> a Constitution by force in Egypt 
<2en> a new gam@@ ble for President Mo@@ ha@@ mm@@ ed Mor@@ si . 
<2en> while Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which tempor@@ arily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for bro@@ ke . 
<2en> taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day . 
<2en> just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work . 
<2en> for two years Egypt has re@@ lied on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weak@@ en@@ ed institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os . 
<2en> this new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country . 
<2en> according to his opponents , the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his " auto@@ crati@@ c deli@@ ri@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' tra@@ mp@@ le the law . " 
<2en> his supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by spee@@ ding up the transition process . 
<2en> a referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks . 
<2en> a very short period , which forces the Bro@@ thers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the E@@ gyp@@ ti@@ ans . 
<2en> for the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country . 
<2en> Mo@@ ha@@ mm@@ ed Mor@@ si seems convinced that E@@ gyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote favou@@ ra@@ bly , as he stated in an inter@@ view with the American week@@ ly Time . 
<2en> particularly since a ha@@ st@@ y vote s@@ ma@@ cks of an ulti@@ ma@@ tum to the E@@ gyp@@ tian people : " either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , " these powers sup@@ pose@@ dly ex@@ pir@@ ing following adoption of the Constitution . 
<2en> it was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Isla@@ mis@@ t majority , voted on the text yesterday . 
<2en> most of the liber@@ als were missing . 
<2en> in mid@@ -@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sla@@ mm@@ ed the door , feeling they had failed to as@@ sert their views . 
<2en> Represen@@ tatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise . 
<2en> in order to obtain a qu@@ or@@ um , 11 members , alterna@@ tes , were has@@ ti@@ ly added yesterday morning . 
<2en> some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood . 
<2en> not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously . 
<2en> com@@ menta@@ tors were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of pra@@ yer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clo@@ ck was wrong . 
<2en> the text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 2@@ 34 articles . 
<2en> the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis iden@@ tical to that of the 197@@ 1 Constitution , stipu@@ lating that " the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . " 
<2en> the Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed stricter application . 
<2en> for the Isla@@ mis@@ ts , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of E@@ gyp@@ tian society . 
<2en> " hypo@@ cris@@ y " respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup . 
<2en> because in their opinion Isla@@ mis@@ ation of the Constitution is done through other articles . 
<2en> they refer in particular to article 2@@ 20 , which grants Al@@ -@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advis@@ ory role , with particular reference to veri@@ fying the confor@@ mity of the laws with sh@@ aria . 
<2en> according to Egypt speci@@ alist S@@ op@@ hie P@@ om@@ mi@@ er , this is worrying because " the people called upon to ad@@ vise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy . 
<2en> this suggests the begin@@ nings of a the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy . " 
<2en> the liber@@ als ' fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Re@@ c@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moder@@ ate than the current one . 
<2en> " for the time being , there is no concrete religious implication . 
<2en> with this Constitution , things remain under civil rule . 
<2en> most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law sch@@ ol@@ ars but acade@@ mi@@ cs , some trained in the French system " qualifi@@ es Ale@@ xis B@@ lou@@ et , who is writing a th@@ es@@ is on the E@@ gyp@@ tian constitutional transition . 
<2en> but he acknowled@@ ges that " there may be some ambigu@@ ity regarding article 2@@ 20 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lary . 
<2en> reference is made in particular to " fi@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic juris@@ prudence , E@@ di@@ tor 's note ] . 
<2en> and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pron@@ oun@@ ce on it . " 
<2en> beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic . 
<2en> the Muslim Bro@@ thers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime . 
<2en> another issue : the powers confer@@ red on the army . 
<2en> in accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council . 
<2en> nor will tri@@ als of civilians will be banned in military tribun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights . 
<2en> who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repres@@ sive . 
<2en> the off@@ ence of bla@@ sp@@ h@@ em@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohib@@ ited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press . 
<2en> in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights H@@ eba Mor@@ a@@ ye@@ f , from Human Rights Wat@@ ch . 
<2en> in her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibi@@ tion of torture in article 36 . 
<2en> the word was not included in the previous Constitution . 
<2en> while the E@@ gyp@@ tian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstra@@ tions are planned for this afternoon . 
<2en> supporters of the He@@ ad of State will mar@@ ch on Sat@@ ur@@ day . 
<2en> in Israel , hol@@ y places await Ukrainian tour@@ ists , the om@@ p@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water 
<2en> the Hol@@ y Land comb@@ ines the spl@@ end@@ our of bibli@@ cal tru@@ ths , modern com@@ fort and prim@@ ev@@ al nature . 
<2en> A@@ I@@ F [ Argu@@ ment@@ i i Fak@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel . 
<2en> let 's wor@@ ship the hol@@ y places 
<2en> it is worth vis@@ iting the Ri@@ ver J@@ or@@ dan where Jes@@ us was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed . 
<2en> it is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism " b@@ ath " are bl@@ essed by God . 
<2en> Gali@@ le@@ e is the place where Jes@@ us performed his ma@@ gic : turned water into wine at a we@@ d@@ ding , wal@@ ked on water , cal@@ med a stor@@ m , and filled the nets . 
<2en> this is also where Jes@@ us came before his disci@@ ples and after the res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion . 
<2en> but the biggest number of hol@@ y places is in Jerusalem . 
<2en> belie@@ vers walk through the Wa@@ y of Grie@@ f or V@@ ia Dol@@ or@@ osa . 
<2en> it star@@ ts by the An@@ ton@@ ia For@@ tress - Pra@@ e@@ tori@@ um - where the jud@@ gement took place , and brings us along the streets of the O@@ ld T@@ own to the Church of the Hol@@ y Se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ th@@ a - the place of the cru@@ cifi@@ xi@@ on , St@@ one of Un@@ ction and the place of Jes@@ us ' bur@@ i@@ al . 
<2en> this is also the location of the symbolic Christian om@@ p@@ hal@@ os , which symbo@@ liz@@ es the sal@@ vation of man@@ kind . 
<2en> the Hol@@ y C@@ ross Mon@@ ast@@ ery in Jerusalem is er@@ ec@@ ted at the site that , according to Christian le@@ gend , yi@@ el@@ ded the tre@@ e used to make the cross for Jes@@ us ' cru@@ cifi@@ xi@@ on . 
<2en> Jerusalem has the most hol@@ y places for the Je@@ ws as well - the Wa@@ iling W@@ all , which remained from a temp@@ le destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 A@@ D . 
<2en> according to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled . 
<2en> travel along a ver@@ tical 
<2en> ru@@ ins of the Mas@@ sa@@ da For@@ tress remain from a secret refu@@ ge from enem@@ ies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family . 
<2en> they are located on cli@@ ffs in the moun@@ tains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level . 
<2en> they can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain cli@@ m@@ bing . 
<2en> others are delivered to this historical moun@@ tain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way . 
<2en> in the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00@@ -@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which fi@@ lls up with tour@@ ists in win@@ ter months . 
<2en> a sh@@ u@@ ttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain . 
<2en> the total length of ski pis@@ tes is 45 km . 
<2en> according to an ancient le@@ gend , pa@@ gan go@@ ds used to live on the mountain . 
<2en> visit unique mu@@ seu@@ ms 
<2en> this country has about 300 mu@@ seu@@ ms . 
<2en> you won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip 
<2en> but at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit . 
<2en> among them - M@@ use@@ um of Israel , located close to K@@ nes@@ set ( Parliament ) . 
<2en> it has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts and De@@ ad Sea s@@ cro@@ lls found in the ca@@ ves of the Ju@@ de@@ an de@@ sert , along with about 5@@ 00@@ ,000 ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ological and an@@ thro@@ po@@ logical ar@@ te@@ facts . 
<2en> the M@@ use@@ um of Art in Tel@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v is also interesting . 
<2en> its exhi@@ b@@ its include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Ren@@ oir , S@@ is@@ ley , C@@ e@@ z@@ an@@ ne , Ma@@ tis@@ se , Mo@@ di@@ gli@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , Pi@@ cas@@ so . 
<2en> in Ak@@ ko , you can visit the b@@ ath mu@@ se@@ um Al@@ -@@ Bas@@ ha , which consists of several ro@@ oms of ancient Turkish ba@@ ths with models of visitors and b@@ ath atten@@ dants of the time . 
<2en> in Ca@@ es@@ area , it is worth vis@@ iting the unique private R@@ all@@ i M@@ use@@ um , where you can enjoy the s@@ culp@@ tures of D@@ ali and Ro@@ din . 
<2en> there are no tour gui@@ des or gi@@ ft shops . 
<2en> entry is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed . 
<2en> the fifth one is the H@@ olo@@ cau@@ st M@@ use@@ um or Y@@ ad V@@ as@@ hem in Tel@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v , which t@@ ells one of the most dramatic st@@ ories in history . 
<2en> the most tragic section is the children 's mem@@ ori@@ al , built in memory of 1.@@ 5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cham@@ bers . 
<2en> you go in and find yourself in complete dar@@ k@@ ness . 
<2en> st@@ ars are g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing , 
<2en> and you listen to names of Je@@ wish children and countries where they died . 
<2en> Ukraine is mentioned there too . 
<2en> w@@ ell@@ ness 
<2en> there are three resort areas in Israel , located on the co@@ ast@@ s of the Mediterranean , Red , and De@@ ad Se@@ as . 
<2en> each have swi@@ mming po@@ ols , aqu@@ a par@@ ks , dol@@ p@@ hin@@ aria and oce@@ an@@ aria . 
<2en> it is notable that one can swi@@ m in the Red Sea even in win@@ ter months , because the water temperat@@ ure does not drop below 21 degre@@ es and the air war@@ ms to 23 degre@@ es . 
<2en> the De@@ ad Sea is even war@@ mer , and people swi@@ m in it all year round . 
<2en> incidentally , it is the most un@@ usual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level . 
<2en> its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keep@@ s you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you don 't know how to swi@@ m . 
<2en> the surrounding lands@@ cap@@ es are sur@@ real in their beau@@ ty . 
<2en> people come here to under@@ go a course of treatment using sal@@ t water - w@@ rap@@ s and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ mati@@ tis , aller@@ gies , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ zem@@ as , ar@@ th@@ ri@@ tis , b@@ ron@@ chi@@ tis , or di@@ abe@@ tes , or to return emo@@ tional balance . 
<2en> touch the my@@ st@@ eries of anti@@ qu@@ ity 
<2en> they are preser@@ ved in the old section of Tel@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v - in the town of Ja@@ ff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea . 
<2en> the famous sea route connec@@ ting Egypt , Syria , A@@ na@@ to@@ lia , and Mes@@ o@@ po@@ ta@@ mi@@ a runs through it . 
<2en> the city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient E@@ gyp@@ tian le@@ gen@@ ds . 
<2en> according to le@@ gen@@ ds , this is where No@@ ah built his ar@@ k and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beau@@ ty An@@ dro@@ me@@ da , with whom he lived a long and happy life . 
<2en> tour@@ ists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ a@@ c . 
<2en> they say , if you touch the w@@ alls on the street of your sign , fort@@ une will come to you . 
<2en> in Ja@@ ff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for p@@ hoto sessions . 
<2en> and in Ca@@ es@@ area - the city of K@@ ing Her@@ od - you can walk around a Rom@@ an the@@ a@@ tre , " cap@@ ture " the C@@ rus@@ ader for@@ tress . 
<2en> during the Rom@@ an period , Ca@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Rom@@ an pre@@ fec@@ ts , including P@@ on@@ ti@@ us Pi@@ late . 
<2en> the carefully restor@@ ed the@@ a@@ tre is now used for evening concer@@ ts and op@@ era performan@@ ces . 
<2en> a note for the tourist 
<2en> when you go to Israel , don 't wor@@ ry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian . 
<2en> for the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily ex@@ changed for she@@ k@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 she@@ k@@ els ) . 
<2en> city transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high@@ -@@ speed tra@@ m , and H@@ ai@@ f@@ a has the only sub@@ way line in the country , com@@ pris@@ ing six stop@@ s and connec@@ ting up@@ per town with lower . 
<2en> in essence , it is an under@@ ground cable railway . 
<2en> a tick@@ et for any type of city transportation costs 6 she@@ k@@ els , and you can ri@@ de for 1.@@ 5 hours with transfers . 
<2en> according to the Je@@ wish tradition , S@@ ab@@ b@@ ath is celeb@@ ra@@ ted in Israel . 
<2en> between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Sat@@ ur@@ day , markets , st@@ ores , and public transportation stop working . 
<2en> the work week star@@ ts on Sunday morning . 
<2en> many ca@@ fes , resta@@ ur@@ ants and ho@@ tels have only ko@@ sh@@ er food , with no por@@ k , se@@ af@@ o@@ od , fish with no sc@@ ales , or dis@@ hes that combine milk with meat . 
<2en> there is a wide selection of dis@@ hes from la@@ m@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts co@@ oked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Je@@ wish hu@@ m@@ mus pas@@ te , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ af@@ el ( b@@ alls made of ground chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vege@@ tables . 
<2en> the streets of Israel don 't have hom@@ eless do@@ gs . 
<2en> but there are many w@@ ell@@ -@@ f@@ ed ca@@ ts , which walk around la@@ zi@@ ly . 
<2en> in the evening , they can even be seen sle@@ ep@@ ing on ro@@ ofs of par@@ ked cars . 
<2en> these pus@@ sy@@ ca@@ ts like bus@@ y places and do not refuse tre@@ ats . 
<2en> car ren@@ tal , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i G@@ etz ) to 18@@ 8 ( Au@@ di A@@ 6 , Vol@@ vo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day . 
<2en> plus insurance of 15 dollars a day . 
<2en> bi@@ ke ren@@ tal costs 15 she@@ k@@ els a day . 
<2en> M@@ use@@ um entr@@ ance costs 30 she@@ k@@ els on average . 
<2en> in numbers 
<2en> in 2012 , over three million tour@@ ists from around the world visited Israel . 
<2en> visitors and holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine . 
<2en> between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian tour@@ ists visited the Hol@@ y Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 . 
<2en> only the " high and mi@@ gh@@ ty " make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language 
<2en> while de@@ pu@@ ties and human rights activ@@ ists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has s@@ ca@@ m arti@@ sts who sell fa@@ ke certifica@@ tes . 
<2en> every year , 13 million mi@@ grant workers come to Moscow , St@@ . Peters@@ burg and other cities in Russia . 
<2en> mostly these are citizens of Central Asia : Uz@@ bekistan , Taj@@ i@@ kistan and Turkmen@@ istan . 
<2en> their only goal is to ear@@ n money to support families back home . 
<2en> a new law came into effect on December 1 , which obli@@ ges every mi@@ grant worker to pass a Russian language test . 
<2en> for the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utili@@ ty services , house@@ hold services , and re@@ tail . 
<2en> but with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non@@ -@@ residents . 
<2en> in addition to language , Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tested . 
<2en> language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit . 
<2en> an exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language . 
<2en> people who received education certifica@@ tes and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ S@@ R in 1991 are also exemp@@ t under the law . 
<2en> purpose , do@@ om@@ ed fate , and the protection of rights 
<2en> seven testing points will be operating under the auspi@@ ces of the P@@ us@@ h@@ kin Institute of Russian Lan@@ gu@@ age , Pe@@ op@@ les ' Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St@@ . Peters@@ burg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions . 
<2en> migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 1@@ 60 such centres have been opened . 
<2en> the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Du@@ ma members and the Federal Migration Services . 
<2en> but human rights activ@@ ists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ? 
<2en> what will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non@@ -@@ residents ? 
<2en> first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour sla@@ very . 
<2en> many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , expla@@ ins the He@@ ad of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Vi@@ ktor S@@ eb@@ ele@@ v . 
<2en> rights protection should begin before their depar@@ ture . 
<2en> only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers . 
<2en> migrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certifica@@ te start to have problems . 
<2en> if a mi@@ grant does not understand the language , says S@@ eb@@ ele@@ v with certainty , he is do@@ om@@ ed to come across un@@ consci@@ enti@@ ous people , who , preten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a " tick@@ et " to terrible , cra@@ m@@ ped bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12@@ -@@ 14 hours a day . 
<2en> we receive many complaints from our migrants . 
<2en> " they are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their pass@@ ports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , " confirms the He@@ ad of the Ma@@ in Mi@@ grant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Taj@@ i@@ kistan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v . 
<2en> not be an@@ gr@@ y , bo@@ ss ! 
<2en> nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can bar@@ ely write in their own language . 
<2en> naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Tur@@ ks , Uz@@ be@@ ks , and Taj@@ i@@ ks can afford even a basic education . 
<2en> their families don 't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clo@@ thing , sho@@ es , and supplies . 
<2en> after reaching ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cence , these ki@@ ds go to work at the first opportunity . 
<2en> it is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit . 
<2en> " you feel hu@@ mi@@ lia@@ ted and inferior . " 
<2en> but human rights activ@@ ists note one important point about the law on language . 
<2en> testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status . 
<2en> if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future . 
<2en> in the meantime , most of the mi@@ grant workers continue to live in Russia illegally . 
<2en> " welcome , or No Un@@ authori@@ zed En@@ try " 
<2en> many of the for@@ eign@@ ers as@@ sert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy . 
<2en> the reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties . 
<2en> in addition , leg@@ aliz@@ ation costs money : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 ru@@ bles . 
<2en> whereas a fa@@ ke registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand . 
<2en> officers of the Russian Poli@@ ce know that we mainly have fa@@ ke papers , without registration , hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion . 
<2en> " they ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , te@@ a , " Um@@ ed K@@ hus@@ h@@ k@@ ada@@ mo@@ v , a citizen of Taj@@ i@@ kistan , shared with journalists . 
<2en> " roll up , don 't be cheap , get your ar@@ t@@ work " 
<2en> on the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only mi@@ grant registration documents can be fa@@ ke . 
<2en> a few for@@ ged certifica@@ tes about passing language tests have been se@@ ized by Federal Migration Services officers already . 
<2en> for@@ ged documents are prin@@ ted on a standard col@@ our prin@@ ter . 
<2en> naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand ru@@ bles for them . 
<2en> it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand . 
<2en> government officials and human rights activ@@ ists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certifica@@ tes could not just be b@@ ought . 
<2en> for the moment , the authorities can promise mi@@ grant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course . 
<2en> in addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people . 
<2en> the Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation 
<2en> the share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low 
<2en> the Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tou@@ gh@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons . 
<2en> this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : click sho@@ ts at we@@ d@@ dings , where there were no casu@@ al@@ ties , and the massac@@ re sta@@ ged by Moscow law@@ yer D@@ mit@@ ry V@@ ino@@ gra@@ do@@ v , resulting in C@@ L@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people . 
<2en> poli@@ c@@ emen want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons li@@ cens@@ ing from 18 to 21 . 
<2en> the idea was supported by the head of the Du@@ ma Committee on Safety and Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ aro@@ vaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Du@@ ma in the near future . 
<2en> not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " ti@@ ghten@@ ing the scre@@ ws . " 
<2en> an open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social rif@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the " sen@@ sel@@ ess tou@@ gh@@ ening . " 
<2en> the percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal law@@ yer V@@ asi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ kov to B@@ BC Russia . 
<2en> according to the Ministry of the Interior 's statistics , 142 crimes using fi@@ re@@ arms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period . 
<2en> authors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ gh@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market . 
<2en> according to them , one can find any weap@@ on at a low price right now . 
<2en> nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control . 
<2en> suppliers : from plants to officers 
<2en> the " black " market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several channels . 
<2en> there are five such channels , expla@@ ins reti@@ red colon@@ el Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Sta@@ ff for 10 years . 
<2en> scre@@ en@@ sho@@ t of the site that accepts orders for weapons . 
<2en> first : " Ar@@ my or military loo@@ t , " i.e. weapons that were stol@@ en during the fighting in the Caucasus . 
<2en> " weapons were stol@@ en by Russian officers and by the Cauca@@ sians , " says Bar@@ an@@ ets . 
<2en> next are " black weapons , " stol@@ en by criminals from representatives of defence agencies . 
<2en> Bar@@ an@@ ets expla@@ ins that this covers weapons taken from police war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses and those stol@@ en directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees . 
<2en> illegal arms are taken to be sold from military war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses . 
<2en> explo@@ sions have often been heard at military war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses . 
<2en> " there are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were inten@@ tional , in order to cover the shortage , " says the former military man . 
<2en> manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets . 
<2en> " there are so many private weapons fac@@ tories now , which do not en@@ dure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert . 
<2en> another source of the " black " market is trafficking . 
<2en> an especially high number of g@@ uns and machine g@@ uns come from poor countries like Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan . 
<2en> " there 's production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a ma@@ fia has formed , which has organized a stream , " expla@@ ins the former military man . 
<2en> where do the weapons come from ? 
<2en> experts coun@@ ted the approxi@@ mate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market . 
<2en> a report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analy@@ sis and Public Management Plan@@ ning in 2011 . 
<2en> experts analy@@ sed the reports of the De@@ partment of the Interior and R@@ os@@ stat , crimin@@ ology liter@@ at@@ ure and open data from port@@ als on weapons . 
<2en> the overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces . 
<2en> half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , " states the report . 
<2en> according to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is th@@ eft during production , 5 % is " black ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology . " 
<2en> a sales consul@@ tant of one of the weapons st@@ ores , who wished to remain an@@ ony@@ mous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by " black " dig@@ gers are not being b@@ ought any more , because they 're too old . 
<2en> according to him , deal@@ ers go to the military war@@ eh@@ ouse for a new bat@@ ch of goods . 
<2en> one piece , for example a T@@ T g@@ un can be b@@ ought from a war@@ rant offi@@ cer . 
<2en> it is issued to him , and given through the f@@ ence . 
<2en> " he takes it to the city and s@@ ells for 900 euros a piece with two ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , " he says . 
<2en> " the truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why perio@@ dic@@ ally , when the crime dete@@ ction rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purch@@ ases from illegal weapons mer@@ chan@@ ts , " says the consul@@ tant . 
<2en> " like in a lu@@ x@@ ury store " 
<2en> the bu@@ yer and s@@ eller often find each other through friends . 
<2en> I looked at sites , blo@@ gs , ti@@ ll someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ vaya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " cor@@ ner " so we can negotiate . 
<2en> I found out the price of the weap@@ on only there 
<2en> military com@@ menta@@ tor Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets 
<2en> to get a weap@@ on , I need someone with connections , says the sales consul@@ tant . - I have an acqu@@ ain@@ tance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable . 
<2en> there are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to " come " there condition@@ ally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his dau@@ ghter lost a to@@ o@@ th . " 
<2en> right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ led@@ us@@ ters , I get them through someone I trust . 
<2en> he also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away . 
<2en> begin@@ ners look for weapons in different ways . 
<2en> former military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a bu@@ yer of illegal weapons in the mid@@ -@@ 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this . 
<2en> the formu@@ las are still the same , according to him . 
<2en> he was given an al@@ bu@@ m of pic@@ tures with " anything and everything . " 
<2en> " I felt like I was in a lu@@ x@@ ury store , " he rec@@ alls . 
<2en> according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the bu@@ yer is not offered a pi@@ g in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything . 
<2en> I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the s@@ eller and set a target there . 
<2en> " I am given the opportunity to sho@@ ot , and when I am certain that the weap@@ on is good , we begin to negotiate , " descri@@ bes the expert . 
<2en> store on a sof@@ a 
<2en> Internet se@@ ar@@ ches lead to sites and " V@@ kon@@ ta@@ kte " groups , where weapons " for different purposes " are on offer . 
<2en> no documents or personal meetings are needed . 
<2en> " it 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the adver@@ ti@@ sement heading on the website " Bu@@ y a pis@@ to@@ l or rif@@ le . " 
<2en> users leave their requests and ask questions . 
<2en> can a minor buy ? 
<2en> " without a licen@@ se , of course , " asks user " John " ( name is changed ) . 
<2en> " want to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , " con@@ cis@@ ely requests " F@@ ed@@ or@@ en@@ kov . " 
<2en> federal Security Service now spread a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons . 
<2en> people come like h@@ ung@@ ry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Si@@ ber@@ ia . 
<2en> military com@@ menta@@ tor and former military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets 
<2en> I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of appli@@ c@@ ability of the laws of Russia . 
<2en> people accept orders . 
<2en> the bu@@ yer pays at an AT@@ M . 
<2en> " in response , a p@@ hoto is sent with instructions on where the weap@@ on is hi@@ dden , " says Pres@@ s Secretary of the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons non@@ -@@ governmental organization D@@ mit@@ ry K@@ is@@ lo@@ v . 
<2en> Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weap@@ on and go to ja@@ il . 
<2en> the Federal Security Service now spre@@ ads a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons . 
<2en> " people are like h@@ ung@@ ry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Si@@ ber@@ ia mining coal , " - he says . 
<2en> Ma@@ k@@ aro@@ v for 100 dollars 
<2en> when buying illegal fi@@ re@@ arms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts . 
<2en> according to D@@ mit@@ ry K@@ is@@ lo@@ v from the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons organization , a Ma@@ k@@ aro@@ v g@@ un can be acquired for 100@@ -@@ 300 dollars . 
<2en> the wait time is a month to a month and a half . 
<2en> it is ship@@ ped from long@@ -@@ term storage war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses by the mid@@ -@@ level management of these war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses . 
<2en> according to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dro@@ pped 7 % as compared to Janu@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ October 2011 , amoun@@ ting to 2@@ 2,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of th@@ eft and ex@@ tor@@ tion of weapons , am@@ muni@@ tion , explo@@ sive substances and explo@@ sive devices dro@@ pped by 7.@@ 8 % . 
<2en> fa@@ st@@ -@@ food and super@@ market workers are on strike in the U@@ .S@@ .@@ A@@ . 
<2en> up to a fourth of all American te@@ en@@ agers have worked the cash register at Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's at one time or another 
<2en> in the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U@@ .S@@ .@@ A@@ . against low sal@@ aries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain resta@@ ur@@ ants like Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's , Bur@@ ger K@@ ing , T@@ ac@@ o Bel@@ l , W@@ en@@ dy 's and Ken@@ tu@@ cky Fri@@ ed Chi@@ cken . 
<2en> right now , nobody is able to predic@@ t whether this wave will turn into the n@@ in@@ th wave or it is dest@@ ined to fi@@ z@@ z@@ le out early . 
<2en> actions are being supported by unions and a series of le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing organizations . 
<2en> in addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food cha@@ ins , the goal of the pro@@ tes@@ ters is to create unions within them . 
<2en> this sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet . 
<2en> 46 cents a year ? 
<2en> actions began last week after Than@@ ks@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by cla@@ sh@@ es . 
<2en> on this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corpor@@ ation , which emplo@@ ys 2.@@ 2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and pic@@ ke@@ ted together with the unions and le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing activ@@ ists from the corpor@@ ation st@@ ores that sell products to people on low@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ medium incomes . 
<2en> Wal@@ mar@@ t s@@ ells everything imagin@@ able , from di@@ aper@@ s , hun@@ ting rif@@ les and car bat@@ teri@@ es , to vac@@ u@@ um clean@@ ers , eg@@ gs and milk . 
<2en> products in its st@@ ores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major super@@ markets . 
<2en> so many low@@ -@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace . 
<2en> availability and ass@@ or@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corpor@@ ations . 
<2en> according to cri@@ tics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products cheap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees . 
<2en> these latter also compla@@ in about hard work conditions , for example lack of li@@ ft tru@@ cks and hand@@ -@@ held scan@@ ners . 
<2en> pro@@ tes@@ ters on Black Friday demanded a sal@@ ary increase and compla@@ ined that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpor@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month . 
<2en> a typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employe@@ e , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this . 
<2en> scientists from the Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey University in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average sal@@ ary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corpor@@ ation 3.@@ 2 billion dollars . 
<2en> this is about 1.@@ 1 % more than it spen@@ ds on sal@@ aries right now . 
<2en> if Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shi@@ f@@ ts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more . 
<2en> in one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now . 
<2en> Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters hap@@ pi@@ ly note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpor@@ ation . 
<2en> black Friday continued in its st@@ ores from 8 in the evening on Thursday ti@@ ll mid@@ night the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5@@ 000 products a second . 
<2en> in total , its cash regis@@ ters conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday . 
<2en> representative of the corpor@@ ation , D@@ an Fo@@ gel@@ man , asser@@ ted in an inter@@ view with a le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st , that a total of " less than five " Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just " another P@@ R tri@@ ck " of the union that organized it . 
<2en> " free cash register ! " 
<2en> protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don 't exist here yet ) , but Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's and other cheap resta@@ ur@@ ants . 
<2en> Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's says that it s@@ ells billi@@ ons of por@@ tions , and despite this it do@@ es@@ n 't even give you si@@ ck days or pay you for honest work ! 
<2en> Ju@@ ma@@ ane Wil@@ li@@ ams , member of the City Council of New York 
<2en> at the moment , the minimum sal@@ ary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour . 
<2en> fast food resta@@ ur@@ ants increase it with time , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in New York ear@@ n 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour . 
<2en> nobody ear@@ ns less in this expensive city . 
<2en> I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money . 
<2en> once upon a time , almost a fourth of American te@@ en@@ agers went through Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's , working part@@ -@@ time after school , living with parents . 
<2en> few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long . 
<2en> now I continu@@ ously come across inter@@ views with Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's employees , who compla@@ in that they have to survive on this sal@@ ary and sometimes even feed their children . 
<2en> on the other hand , there is a comment on the W@@ all Stre@@ et Jour@@ nal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them . 
<2en> participants of the protest that began at 6@@ .30 a.@@ m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's on 40@@ th street and Mad@@ ison A@@ venue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and co@@ o@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages . 
<2en> they also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry . 
<2en> American law prohib@@ its the administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activ@@ ists of the union movement by na@@ g@@ ging or fir@@ ing . 
<2en> on the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life . 
<2en> but for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union . 
<2en> one of them is the un@@ usual tur@@ no@@ ver of employees . 
<2en> dis@@ agre@@ eing 
<2en> no@@ is@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap resta@@ ur@@ ants in Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan . 
<2en> the highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's by Times S@@ qu@@ are , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Wil@@ li@@ ams , said : " Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d 's claims it s@@ ells billi@@ ons of por@@ tions , and despite this it do@@ es@@ n 't even give you si@@ ck days or pay you for honest work ! " 
<2en> demonstra@@ tors were supported by other pro@@ minent N@@ Y democra@@ ts , like Bil@@ l de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city mayor , who said : " we need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic w@@ ell@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . " 
<2en> according to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry . 
<2en> but only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which com@@ prise tens of thousands of people in New York . 
<2en> it is un@@ clear right now whether this will spar@@ k a mass movement . 
<2en> " at the moment , the mind cannot be dec@@ ei@@ ved too well " 
<2en> among modern technology f@@ ans a popular topic is augmen@@ ted reality , la@@ tely seen primarily through the pr@@ ism of special gla@@ sses . 
<2en> at first , a fun@@ ctional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft fi@@ led an application for patent too . 
<2en> however , according to the conver@@ sation with the leader of the group of inter@@ active 3@@ D technologies in the Cam@@ bridge labor@@ atory of Microsoft , Sha@@ hra@@ m Iz@@ ad@@ i , gla@@ sses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company . 
<2en> they are drawn by the prospect of manipu@@ lating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open s@@ paces . 
<2en> - P@@ le@@ ase tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does . 
<2en> - We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the bound@@ aries of this interaction . 
<2en> while people in general are stu@@ ck at working with pi@@ x@@ els on a fla@@ t screen and sometimes pointing fin@@ gers at them . 
<2en> we want to look 5@@ -@@ 10 years into the future and predic@@ t car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction . 
<2en> for example , X@@ box and Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors are a step forward . almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ec@@ t today , because everyone li@@ kes control by gest@@ ures . 
<2en> - W@@ hat else a@@ wa@@ its us in the future ? 
<2en> - Des@@ pi@@ te the fact that Kin@@ ec@@ t shi@@ f@@ ted the interaction to the physical level , much still oc@@ curs on a fla@@ t screen , sometimes in 3@@ D . 
<2en> information entry has improved ( the system recei@@ ves more data ) , but output still needs to get better . 
<2en> we are trying to change this , working on truly thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al display systems based on various technologies , including pro@@ jec@@ tion technologies . 
<2en> we need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible . 
<2en> but for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him . 
<2en> then we will be able to sup@@ plement the real world with virtual objects in a much more conven@@ ient form . 
<2en> above all , get rid of these stu@@ pi@@ d virtual reality hel@@ mets ! 
<2en> - W@@ hat do you think about voice control ? 
<2en> it 's a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ? 
<2en> - It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions . 
<2en> in reality , all types of interaction with compu@@ ters are good , but each in their own ni@@ che . 
<2en> for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reser@@ ved ones . 
<2en> movements were not recorded by a ca@@ mera , but by a hand bra@@ cel@@ et that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cles . 
<2en> it 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch . 
<2en> in general , the future lies in the mixed control , e@@ .@@ g@@ . movement + voice . 
<2en> - W@@ hat do you mean ? 
<2en> - F@@ or example , how would you ask me to give you this bo@@ ttle of water ? 
<2en> you will talk and show at the same time . 
<2en> - U@@ su@@ ally I just say . 
<2en> - O@@ h , that will be very hard to dete@@ ct . 
<2en> - S@@ o you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ? 
<2en> - No@@ t necessarily , but it is a mutual approxi@@ mation . 
<2en> I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sen@@ sors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction . 
<2en> this could be , e@@ .@@ g@@ . la@@ ser sen@@ sors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very important . 
<2en> - I@@ f we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors , what are your complaints about modern ca@@ mer@@ as ? 
<2en> not enough resolution , depth or something else ? 
<2en> - In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al recognition . 
<2en> of course , it would be good to have eight me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els with 1000 k / s speed . 
<2en> it 's not just the me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the ma@@ tri@@ x and the depth . 
<2en> from the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this ad@@ ds work to the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m de@@ sign@@ ers . 
<2en> so it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z a@@ xis . 
<2en> speed , the number of images per second , is also very important . 
<2en> human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures . 
<2en> Ste@@ ven Ba@@ thi@@ che from our Red@@ mon@@ d labor@@ atory created a touch sens@@ or with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern seri@@ al sen@@ sors are closer to the latter indica@@ tor ( 60@@ -@@ 100 ) . 
<2en> not everyone under@@ stands how this affects the interaction between man and machine . 
<2en> in my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touch@@ ing and would have more images per second . 
<2en> - Do@@ es the number of ca@@ mer@@ as need to be increased ? 
<2en> - In Kin@@ ec@@ t there are three ca@@ mer@@ as now , one of which is actually an infr@@ ared em@@ it@@ ter and the second one , the recipi@@ ent of the signal . 
<2en> the third one is actually a regular sens@@ or of visible range . 
<2en> it is not applied to determine the object 's depth . 
<2en> potentially , a large number of ca@@ mer@@ as could solve the problem ... 
<2en> or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calcu@@ lations . 
<2en> it would be nice to create a flexible analo@@ gue Kin@@ ec@@ t , play with the flexi@@ on of ca@@ mera disposition and see how this will help in thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al determination of the position . 
<2en> - As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gla@@ sses to the public , unlike Google . 
<2en> D@@ on 't you think this is one of the most promis@@ ing plat@@ forms from the point of view the everyday use of augmen@@ ted reality technologies ? 
<2en> - Cer@@ tain@@ ly it is not very conven@@ ient to walk around with a smar@@ t phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the co@@ ol@@ est option would be " transitional " augmen@@ ted reality , where you could shift from gla@@ sses to smar@@ t phone , pro@@ jec@@ tion display , and everywhere else based on a cl@@ ou@@ d platform . 
<2en> gla@@ sses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weak@@ ness - augmen@@ ted reality based on gla@@ sses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people . 
<2en> - L@@ et us imagine for a minute that manipu@@ lation of virtual h@@ olo@@ graphic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from I@@ ron@@ man , but to a regular person . 
<2en> there is one problem with this idea that the cri@@ tics often point out : no ta@@ cti@@ le feed@@ back ! 
<2en> hands feel nothing ! 
<2en> what answers does your group prepare to this challenge ? 
<2en> - In my lec@@ tures I often say that augmen@@ ted reality is the se@@ vent@@ h consecu@@ tive attempt at the interaction between man and machine . 
<2en> I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of ta@@ cti@@ le sensa@@ tions . 
<2en> for now , one of the interesting tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of ma@@ tri@@ x for the image . 
<2en> it is great at regis@@ tering pus@@ hes ! 
<2en> but there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tangi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultra@@ sound ra@@ ys in a specific point where the fin@@ ger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , as if someone ble@@ w on your fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p . 
<2en> there are also w@@ r@@ ist bra@@ cel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in fin@@ gers , which is also a promis@@ ing area . 
<2en> - Ha@@ ve you tried to dec@@ ei@@ ve the mind ? 
<2en> to force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ? 
<2en> - This is a good idea and we ha@@ ven 't tried this yet . 
<2en> it conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ cally in a very limited space to believe that he is wal@@ king along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ admi@@ lls ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving plat@@ forms , and gi@@ ant bal@@ lo@@ ons . 
<2en> so far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come . 
<2en> that 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very begin@@ nings . 
<2en> jud@@ gement calls instead of culture - R@@ os@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ ru 
<2en> R@@ os@@ bal@@ t continues the project St@@ . Peters@@ burg A@@ van@@ t@@ -@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avan@@ t@@ -@@ garde of culture and art . 
<2en> this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St@@ . Peters@@ burg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , by@@ passing fa@@ me in Russia . 
<2en> the new player in R@@ os@@ bal@@ t - the b@@ old arti@@ st Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler . 
<2en> the whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler , a be@@ ar@@ ded man dres@@ sed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian M@@ use@@ um , or by the Su@@ mmer Gar@@ den , or at fashi@@ onable parties and shows . 
<2en> Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler 's work always brings in cro@@ w@@ ds of people , no matter where they are exhi@@ b@@ ited . 
<2en> Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is one of the purely St@@ . Peters@@ burg social and philosop@@ hi@@ cal stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers and cre@@ ators of new my@@ th@@ ology . 
<2en> Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is an outstanding man of the St@@ . Peters@@ burg avan@@ t@@ -@@ garde of the late 80 's early 90 's . 
<2en> moreover , he is a city man , who makes people s@@ mi@@ le on the street and lif@@ ts up everyone 's spirit . 
<2en> recently he took up the street organ and became St@@ . Peters@@ burg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his B@@ oh@@ emi@@ an existence , philosophy and image . 
<2en> - Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why do you walk around the city all in red , not y@@ el@@ low or tur@@ quo@@ ise , for example ? 
<2en> - I chose the col@@ our red as a fashion de@@ signer engaged in look and image . 
<2en> in this world , red is a compromise between arti@@ st , ima@@ ge@@ -@@ ma@@ ker and society . 
<2en> although in society , everything that is not gre@@ y causes aggres@@ sion and agi@@ tation of the bad kind . 
<2en> but my provo@@ cations are aimed at starting conver@@ sation . 
<2en> the whole history of my provo@@ ca@@ tive actions is an invitation to discussion . 
<2en> - W@@ hen did you realise that you must be an arti@@ st ? 
<2en> - A@@ t an exhibi@@ tion in the N@@ ev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was dis@@ played . 
<2en> it became clear to me that this is my path . 
<2en> then , the wave of older free , un@@ official arti@@ sts was gone , while new , free arti@@ sts like me were not understood . 
<2en> I became friends with the arti@@ sts of the new wave , with post@@ -@@ Gaz@@ a@@ -@@ N@@ ev@@ sky style arti@@ sts ( " post@@ -@@ ga@@ zon@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina " ) , which led to P@@ us@@ h@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer . 
<2en> I 'm drawn to the@@ a@@ tre , clo@@ thing , music , all gen@@ res except for liter@@ at@@ ure . 
<2en> - An@@ d all this has been united in your Ar@@ t@@ -@@ clini@@ c ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St@@ . Peters@@ burg , where all the best creative forces should come together . 
<2en> in 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ us@@ h@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and while the renov@@ ation work had not started , there was a musi@@ cal and creative club , a B@@ oh@@ emi@@ an club , the house of the St@@ . Peters@@ burg B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia . 
<2en> many were born there : N@@ om@@ y , T@@ equi@@ la Ja@@ z@@ z , I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh 's E@@ ar project . 
<2en> Sh@@ nur and his friends li@@ p sang easy son@@ gs , we@@ aring ti@@ ght le@@ o@@ tar@@ ds , and the now tren@@ dy com@@ poser I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ vin was with them . 
<2en> when the group began to play live , it became Len@@ in@@ grad . 
<2en> Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the presen@@ ter of many programs before H@@ ali@@ -@@ G@@ ali times . 
<2en> we gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and men@@ tor@@ ing he received from us . 
<2en> G@@ aller@@ y D 137 , G@@ ri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these e@@ cho the Ar@@ t@@ -@@ clini@@ c . 
<2en> that is where our staff and regular customers left for . 
<2en> I am a her@@ o of the last century , when culture meant something . 
<2en> in 2000 , there was a po@@ ll in the press , for the People of O@@ ur City pri@@ ze . 
<2en> I was nomin@@ ated Ar@@ ti@@ st of the Year , my cli@@ ma@@ x came to an end . 
<2en> in the new times , it is un@@ comfor@@ table to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , hon@@ esty and culture of the last century . 
<2en> in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popu@@ lar@@ ity are different . you can be popular , but not very cultural . 
<2en> - Y@@ our work is marked by a recogni@@ z@@ able style . 
<2en> - M@@ any of my works are h@@ its , with clearly reflected relev@@ ance and acu@@ ity . 
<2en> I will have a programme exhi@@ bit , " Russian mu@@ se@@ um in c@@ low@@ ns . " 
<2en> c@@ low@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category . 
<2en> I was social before , now it is painful and scar@@ y to be like that . 
<2en> but everything is bl@@ ur@@ red in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed . 
<2en> I like gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas . 
<2en> for example , saving the world by totali@@ tarian changing of clo@@ th@@ es by order . 
<2en> nowadays , people are jud@@ ged by appearance , not their in@@ ner qualities . 
<2en> who knows , maybe you cannot sha@@ ke his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face . 
<2en> and the lie will go away with the help of changing clo@@ th@@ es . 
<2en> - Re@@ c@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character . 
<2en> who f@@ its the role better than I ? 
<2en> - May@@ be commercial art can also be beautiful ? 
<2en> - No@@ wadays , commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , swe@@ et . 
<2en> there is a dis@@ integration of cultures . 
<2en> people used to get together in flo@@ cks , B@@ oh@@ emi@@ ans liked one thing , the simple people , something else . 
<2en> now , everybody is divided into micro societies , it 's hard to be liked by everyone . 
<2en> I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all . 
<2en> now you have to think who you will please . 
<2en> now , each cul@@ t her@@ o has 100 f@@ ans . 
<2en> - B@@ ut several thousand come to S@@ tas Mi@@ kha@@ i@@ lo@@ v ! 
<2en> - The ca@@ st@@ -@@ ou@@ ts go to see him , the sexu@@ al@@ -@@ social sphere is at work there . 
<2en> but 300 people will come for culture , not 10@@ ,000 . in the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out . 
<2en> I have f@@ ans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have ear@@ ned . 
<2en> in my youth , I pain@@ ted such art that one collec@@ tor had it han@@ ging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov . 
<2en> I started with pain@@ t@@ ings , which people usually end with . 
<2en> concepts are often mixed up these days . 
<2en> people say : spir@@ itual culture , consumer culture . 
<2en> there is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it 's " from another op@@ era . " 
<2en> I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I gre@@ w up on examples of arti@@ sts who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of pain@@ ting . 
<2en> this is the culture I 'm for . 
<2en> - Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what is St@@ . Peters@@ burg missing ? 
<2en> - Go@@ od cultural experts . 
<2en> there is such a thing : an official for culture . 
<2en> but not everyone can be engaged in culture . 
<2en> under the right ru@@ lers everything was different . K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts . 
<2en> there are good consul@@ tants in Moscow right now . 
<2en> here in St@@ . Peters@@ burg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pus@@ hed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them . 
<2en> jud@@ gement calls are what th@@ ri@@ ve now . 
<2en> even Er@@ art , but they 're different because they say hon@@ est@@ ly that we don 't accept all modern art . there are some arti@@ sts , who need to find other mu@@ seu@@ ms for themselves . 
<2en> - W@@ hat does St@@ . Peters@@ burg mean to you ? 
<2en> - St@@ . Peters@@ burg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there . 
<2en> it 's hard for art to grow on our ro@@ cks . 
<2en> we need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writ@@ ers than re@@ a@@ ders . this is wrong . 
<2en> in Europe , there are many curi@@ ous people , who go to art exhi@@ b@@ its , concer@@ ts . 
<2en> here , this la@@ yer is thin . 
<2en> we need to make art fashi@@ onable , as it was in the beginning of last century . 
<2en> the project is supported by the St@@ . Peters@@ burg grant . 
<2en> give birth in space 
<2en> the earth is in danger . 
<2en> global warming or an en@@ counter with a kil@@ ler ast@@ ero@@ id . 
<2en> car@@ av@@ ans of cos@@ mic ships with human@@ s on board leave in search of a re@@ placement planet . 
<2en> to save humanity , the question is how to propa@@ gate our race in conditions of wei@@ gh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness or on that re@@ placement planet ? 
<2en> I think the choice is small . 
<2en> there are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explor@@ ed even hypo@@ the@@ tically . 
<2en> " Ven@@ us and M@@ ars , " says S@@ eni@@ or Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K@@ . Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ y Institute ( GA@@ IS@@ h ) Vladi@@ mir S@@ ur@@ din . 
<2en> but while conditions on M@@ ars are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degree temperat@@ ures . 
<2en> life is possible only at a high al@@ titude or on the or@@ bit of Ven@@ us ... in space . 
<2en> the question of re@@ production in space began with fl@@ ora . 
<2en> half a century ago , experi@@ ments were run on plants . 
<2en> four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counter@@ parts . 
<2en> then , in@@ sec@@ ts were bre@@ d in or@@ bit , small fruit fli@@ es . 
<2en> in 197@@ 9 , qua@@ il eg@@ gs were sent to space , to check how an emb@@ r@@ yo develop@@ s in wei@@ gh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness . 
<2en> we get an absolutely normal chi@@ ck . 
<2en> but then the problem beg@@ ins . 
<2en> " the problem is related to the fact that this chi@@ ck needs to find support , needs to get on its fe@@ et and start moving , " expla@@ ins head of the labor@@ atory of the Institute of Medi@@ cal and Bi@@ ological Problems ( IM@@ BP ) R@@ AN Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v . 
<2en> having found no support , chi@@ cks were tum@@ bling around in dis@@ order . 
<2en> after 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete at@@ rop@@ hy of inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts . 
<2en> chi@@ cks did not react to light and sound . 
<2en> and the problem was that they simply died after four days . 
<2en> " we bre@@ d chi@@ cks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the experi@@ ment with chi@@ cks in space . 
<2en> the last biological " mini@@ -@@ ar@@ k " with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago . 
<2en> in spring 2013 , experi@@ ments will continue . 
<2en> however , only sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex beings will be on the Bi@@ on bio@@ -@@ satellite . 
<2en> there was an experi@@ ment with ra@@ ts , who were sent to space with fo@@ e@@ tus . 
<2en> in principle , there was nothing extraordinary there . 
<2en> " this was on bio@@ -@@ satel@@ li@@ tes , but again , it was a sin@@ gu@@ lar experi@@ ment and such research needs to be conducted , " says Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v . 
<2en> after lan@@ ding , the cos@@ mic ra@@ ts had bab@@ ies . 
<2en> but it 's hard to solve the problem of re@@ production directly in space . 
<2en> it 's not an easy task . 
<2en> animals simply cannot follow their sexual inst@@ in@@ ct , when they 're out of their familiar environment . 
<2en> in principle , people , unlike animals , can . 
<2en> Hom@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens have abstra@@ ct thinking , and are able to create a fit@@ ting emo@@ tional background . 
<2en> such experi@@ ments are not conducted for ethical reasons . 
<2en> but women have been f@@ lying to space for 50 years . 
<2en> the biggest risk was for Ter@@ es@@ h@@ kov@@ a . 
<2en> the most valuable thing for humanity is the female body . 
<2en> our " Se@@ agu@@ ll " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be O@@ K after f@@ lying to space . 
<2en> whether she will be able to give birth after this flight . 
<2en> " nobody answered this question , " says ro@@ cket and space industry ve@@ ter@@ an , V@@ ak@@ h@@ tan@@ g V@@ ach@@ nad@@ ze . 
<2en> in June 196@@ 4 , only a year after f@@ lying to space , the first woman in space Val@@ ent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ kov@@ a gave birth to a dau@@ ghter . 
<2en> the child 's father , An@@ dri@@ an Ni@@ ko@@ la@@ e@@ v , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut . 
<2en> in 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , S@@ ve@@ tlan@@ a Sav@@ it@@ ska@@ ya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son . 
<2en> however , the risk remains . 
<2en> we have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were O@@ K and had healthy children after long flights . 
<2en> " what 's more , it is dangerous even for or@@ bi@@ tal flights , " ad@@ ds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , Her@@ o of the US@@ S@@ R , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Po@@ lia@@ kov . 
<2en> and yet , humanity needs to seek out some new a@@ ven@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial grav@@ ity . 
<2en> Hy@@ dro@@ -@@ labor@@ atory of C@@ P@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight . 
<2en> here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o@@ -@@ grav@@ ity conditions . 
<2en> water imi@@ ta@@ tes wei@@ gh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness . 
<2en> if for adul@@ ts water is a foreign medium , although comfor@@ table , for inf@@ ants it is a na@@ tive element . 
<2en> small am@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the oce@@ an . 
<2en> there is a connection with the fact that an inf@@ ant spen@@ ds about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that . 
<2en> in principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first ba@@ thing . 
<2en> " this is very little time to forget something , " says inf@@ ant swi@@ mming instruc@@ tor Mar@@ ina Ak@@ sen@@ ov@@ a . 
<2en> in other words , if for a new@@ born wei@@ gh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness is more natural , a woman needs grav@@ ity , earth 's pu@@ ll . 
<2en> st@@ om@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ cles usually quickly de@@ generate in wei@@ gh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness ; the ability to push out the emb@@ r@@ yo is reduced . 
<2en> well , let 's assume that child@@ birth stimu@@ la@@ tors will work out . 
<2en> maybe she will push out the bab@@ y in a special room . 
<2en> " then what ? " - asks Val@@ ery Po@@ lia@@ kov about this non@@ -@@ tri@@ vial issue . 
<2en> on the other hand , a bab@@ y also needs artificial grav@@ ity . 
<2en> when a body does not feel the earth 's pu@@ ll , it does not form the sk@@ ele@@ tal and mus@@ cular system . 
<2en> it is not possible to dres@@ s a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special lo@@ ading suit for training , as they do with adul@@ ts . 
<2en> he will simply not have what he needs to survive . 
<2en> " and this experi@@ ment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a han@@ di@@ cap@@ ped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , " predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ eth@@ ics IM@@ BP R@@ AN I@@ g@@ or P@@ esto@@ v . 
<2en> for the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory . 
<2en> however , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ spring , who were born in space . 
<2en> N@@ K@@ U He@@ ad : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians . 
<2en> the Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application . 
<2en> this was said by Milo@@ sla@@ v K@@ ala , vi@@ ce@@ -@@ president of the Su@@ pre@@ me Au@@ dit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an inter@@ view for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ c@@ z. 
<2en> " the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states K@@ ala , commen@@ ting on the current situation . 
<2en> similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German audi@@ tors . 
<2en> as an example of impro@@ per practice , they cite P@@ et@@ r N@@ ec@@ as 's approach to the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ var@@ c System . " 
<2en> the Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ den@@ ing business owners with its checks - so is it for@@ bi@@ dden or allowed ? 
<2en> " the Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its de@@ partment , which is du@@ ty@@ -@@ bound to monitor and enforce , " asser@@ ts K@@ ala . 
<2en> at the audit committee 's session in the House of De@@ pu@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared . 
<2en> what exactly was this about ? 
<2en> this is about parallel audi@@ ting , which we began around two years ago . 
<2en> simply put , this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legisla@@ tions and then the actual practice itself . 
<2en> we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more con@@ cise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany . 
<2en> this confirms that creating more and more con@@ cise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws . 
<2en> what does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ? 
<2en> this kind of joint audit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect bound@@ aries , when it does not have such a positive impact . 
<2en> economy means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that prof@@ ite@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided . 
<2en> however , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be procu@@ red . 
<2en> the system might become over@@ lo@@ aded with the amount of pa@@ per@@ work , and those , who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher . 
<2en> these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts . 
<2en> how does the audit system work in Germany ? 
<2en> is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ? 
<2en> as far as the office is concerned , the Bundes@@ re@@ chn@@ ungsh@@ of functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly . 
<2en> powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of audi@@ tors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own . 
<2en> the B@@ R@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds . 
<2en> public funds , which , for us , are adminis@@ tered by regional and municip@@ al authorities , are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there . 
<2en> when it comes to their legislation , is it more stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward than ours ? 
<2en> overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect . 
<2en> is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ? 
<2en> that is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ isons . 
<2en> it should be said that even in a country we percei@@ ve as exemp@@ lary , they en@@ counter a whole range of problems . 
<2en> if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ? 
<2en> coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ? 
<2en> the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifes@@ ted itself in our audit work yet . 
<2en> since we carry out our audi@@ ts ex@@ -@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account . 
<2en> as yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audi@@ ts - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk dete@@ ction " system , with which we have proces@@ sed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjus@@ ted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on . 
<2en> so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ? 
<2en> I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed . 
<2en> a problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes " too constra@@ ined " and will not be enfor@@ ce@@ able . 
<2en> under the previous rules , parties being audi@@ ted were already bound by their audit provi@@ der ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline . 
<2en> is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ? 
<2en> I do not think this is the way . 
<2en> the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techni@@ cali@@ ty , which does not affect the final decision . 
<2en> this kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy . 
<2en> so how can we get out of this ? 
<2en> let 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us . 
<2en> the Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ den@@ ing busin@@ ess@@ men with audi@@ ts of the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ var@@ c System " - what does this mean ? 
<2en> is the S@@ var@@ c System prohib@@ ited or allowed ? 
<2en> the Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its de@@ partment , which is du@@ ty@@ -@@ bound to monitor and enforce . 
<2en> he may say : " let us change this law and rela@@ x it , " but he cannot say we should pre@@ tend it is not there . 
<2en> the law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the forma@@ lities which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected . 
<2en> on the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ d@@ der with the best offer is excluded on a techni@@ cali@@ ty . 
<2en> the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . 
<2en> roads are i@@ cy in places , but mostly pass@@ able . 
<2en> in several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are i@@ cy and s@@ no@@ w@@ y . 
<2en> however , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places . 
<2en> Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region 
<2en> in the Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been us@@ able this morning , though in some places they were i@@ cy and s@@ no@@ w@@ y . 
<2en> the temperat@@ ure has dro@@ pped to between five and ten degre@@ es below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day . 
<2en> s@@ no@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin la@@ yer of s@@ now remains in the low@@ lands . 
<2en> however , the ri@@ dges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mo@@ un@@ tains have around 30 cen@@ time@@ tres of s@@ now . 
<2en> in some lo@@ cations there is limited visi@@ bility due to mis@@ t , according to the local high@@ way service . 
<2en> the R@@ 6 high@@ -@@ speed motor@@ way and primary roads in the region are now us@@ able without restriction . 
<2en> caution is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bri@@ dges , where the surface can be i@@ cy and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y . 
<2en> all secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads . 
<2en> in certain stre@@ t@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining fro@@ zen and com@@ pac@@ ted s@@ now pat@@ ches . 
<2en> above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving . 
<2en> Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ de@@ c K@@ r@@ alo@@ ve region 
<2en> on some roads in Eastern B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher al@@ titudes and in the moun@@ tains there might be a la@@ yer of com@@ pac@@ ted s@@ now , according to the Ro@@ ad and Mo@@ tor@@ way Direc@@ torate . 
<2en> the high@@ way service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher al@@ titudes of the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region in particular . 
<2en> black ice may occur around L@@ ans@@ kro@@ un , U@@ sti nad Or@@ li@@ ci , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vi@@ ta@@ vy , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads . 
<2en> the I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chemi@@ cally treated around S@@ vi@@ ta@@ vy . 
<2en> s@@ now is particularly affecting the roads in the K@@ r@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke moun@@ tains . 
<2en> at higher al@@ titudes , there is a com@@ pac@@ ted s@@ now la@@ yer on the roads around R@@ ych@@ no@@ v nad K@@ nez@@ nou and T@@ ru@@ t@@ no@@ v . 
<2en> in Eastern B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly cl@@ ou@@ dy , and dry . 
<2en> temperat@@ ures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree C@@ el@@ si@@ us mostly , with a light wind . 
<2en> P@@ il@@ sen region 
<2en> the roads in the P@@ il@@ sen region have been us@@ able this morning , with extra care needed in some places . drivers should take the wea@@ ther conditions into account . 
<2en> the morning will be fro@@ st@@ y , with temperat@@ ures ranging between three and nine degre@@ es below zero . 
<2en> due to the existing s@@ now and subsequent drop in temperat@@ ure , certain roads may be i@@ cy . 
<2en> drivers should expect mis@@ t in places , though visi@@ bility will gradually improve . 
<2en> this information was reported by the region 's high@@ way service . 
<2en> the D@@ 5 motor@@ way is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 8@@ 0@@ th and 13@@ 1@@ st kilome@@ tre marks . 
<2en> most primary road sur@@ faces are dry and fro@@ st@@ -@@ free . 
<2en> southern areas of the P@@ il@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have i@@ cy pat@@ ches . 
<2en> secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are w@@ et , and may therefore also have i@@ cy pat@@ ches . 
<2en> drivers should be cau@@ tious especially on less frequ@@ en@@ ted roads in the B@@ oh@@ emi@@ an For@@ est . 
<2en> Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 
<2en> drivers should expect s@@ now s@@ lus@@ h on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region . 
<2en> it is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to Vi@@ del@@ sky Kri@@ z . 
<2en> s@@ no@@ w@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were brought out by falling s@@ now over@@ night , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to high@@ way maintenance , got around three cen@@ time@@ tres of s@@ now . 
<2en> in other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions . 
<2en> " in the Sum@@ per@@ k region , tra@@ ces of s@@ now have remained at the highest al@@ titudes . 
<2en> drivers should expect s@@ now s@@ lus@@ h at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ ke sed@@ lo in the direction of Jes@@ eni@@ k , " the dis@@ pa@@ tch offi@@ cer for the Sum@@ per@@ k high@@ way service told C@@ T@@ K today . 
<2en> their Jes@@ eni@@ k counter@@ parts also made an ou@@ ting over@@ night ; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ titudes are now clear and w@@ et following the chemical treatment , according to them . 
<2en> the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 's roads are us@@ able without restriction , while in the area of Ster@@ n@@ ber@@ k drivers should be@@ ware in wo@@ o@@ ded areas , where roads have remained w@@ et . 
<2en> U@@ sti nad La@@ bem region , Li@@ bere@@ c region 
<2en> since this morning , the s@@ no@@ w@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia . 
<2en> besides certain s@@ no@@ w@@ -@@ covered places , or some i@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to K@@ n@@ ini@@ ce in the U@@ sti nad La@@ bem region is also closed , according to the police database . 
<2en> temperat@@ ures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain s@@ no@@ w@@ y and i@@ cy . in the low@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ the@@ ast of the Central B@@ oh@@ emi@@ an U@@ plan@@ ds , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry . 
<2en> no traffic hol@@ d@@ -@@ up@@ s have so far been reported . 
<2en> i@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti . 
<2en> according to me@@ te@@ or@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts the conditions for this were perfect - rain and mel@@ ting s@@ now during the day , with a clear night and free@@ zing temperat@@ ures . 
<2en> adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti nad La@@ bem and Li@@ bere@@ c regions . 
<2en> the closure of the Tel@@ nice to K@@ n@@ ini@@ ce road was caused by b@@ ent tre@@ e bran@@ ches , which were wei@@ gh@@ ed down to road level by s@@ no@@ w@@ fall .

<2en> it is just another star@@ tler , which we like to la@@ tch on to . 
<2en> together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely . 
<2en> in December you are even organis@@ ing a unique series of three concer@@ ts against the end of the world . 
<2en> can you give our re@@ a@@ ders some details on this ? 
<2en> this is a nation@@ wide fun@@ d@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years . 
<2en> we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the Ma@@ yan cal@@ en@@ dar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.@@ m. 
<2en> on the eve , the 20@@ th of December , at 9@@ p@@ m , 3 concer@@ ts will take place in parallel in Pra@@ gue , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va . 
<2en> they will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i Is@@ land in the Pacifi@@ c , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reach@@ es the end of the Ma@@ yan cal@@ en@@ dar . 
<2en> who came up with this idea ? 
<2en> initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our de@@ signer , Hon@@ za Augus@@ ta . 
<2en> apart from the fact that we want to collec@@ t enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spar@@ e some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children . 
<2en> on the occasion of the end of the Ma@@ yan cal@@ en@@ dar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , sho@@ es , t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , bag@@ s , and original ke@@ ys against the end of the world , which can be pur@@ cha@@ sed at ww@@ w@@ .e@@ -@@ ta@@ p.@@ c@@ z to support our cause . 
<2en> the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other arti@@ sts , also recorded the so@@ -@@ called an@@ them against the end of the world , called " The En@@ d of the World is cancel@@ led . " 
<2en> it is already well received on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , will it figure at the fun@@ d@@ -@@ raising concer@@ ts ? 
<2en> of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end be@@ for@@ eh@@ and . 
<2en> it will be s@@ ung by all the arti@@ sts at all the three concer@@ ts at the same time . 
<2en> the an@@ them will also be fea@@ tured in a unique live broad@@ cast on Czech T@@ elev@@ ision . 
<2en> the words were written and the role of Jes@@ us in the video cli@@ p was played by Tom@@ as Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also sin@@ gs in it ... 
<2en> how did you end up working with them ? 
<2en> we collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ ali@@ ties of the Czech cultural scene , due to organis@@ ing a lot of fun@@ d@@ -@@ raising events and concer@@ ts ... 
<2en> we try to really get them involved in these projects . 
<2en> it turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us . 
<2en> what will the proce@@ eds from the concert against the end of the world go to ? 
<2en> equip@@ ping the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ -@@ accessible educational stu@@ de@@ o centre , which is already in its six@@ th year , in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the disabled . 
<2en> tu@@ tors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them . 
<2en> the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tu@@ tors , so we try to provide this for them in this way . 
<2en> within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project . 
<2en> every concert sees the appearance of several ban@@ ds and arti@@ sts . 
<2en> how do you select them ? 
<2en> we have tried to compi@@ le a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children . 
<2en> for example , in Pra@@ gue , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Sup@@ port Les@@ biens , I@@ ll@@ us@@ tra@@ to@@ sphere with D@@ an Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ arian Ban@@ go and J@@ ir@@ i Su@@ ch@@ y will appear . 
<2en> further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .@@ c@@ z. 
<2en> are you planning any more " bom@@ bas@@ tic events " in the future ? 
<2en> in May , we will be making our first appearance in the Pra@@ gue Spr@@ ing , so we will definitely be preparing a good lin@@ e@@ -@@ up with some interesting guests . 
<2en> next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appear@@ ances in Washington and Chi@@ ca@@ go . 
<2en> your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow . 
<2en> the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band com@@ posed of han@@ di@@ cap@@ ped people . 
<2en> how do you cope with these jour@@ ne@@ ys in terms of logis@@ tics and organisation ? 
<2en> it is not as scar@@ y as it might seem at first . 
<2en> we have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs , which must be transpor@@ ted in the lu@@ g@@ gage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of lu@@ g@@ gage and instrument cases ... 
<2en> nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , C@@ SA and British Air@@ ways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised . 
<2en> even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoo@@ thly . 
<2en> thanks to these international tri@@ ps , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessi@@ bility issues , public attitudes to dis@@ ability and so on . 
<2en> what have been your experiences so far ? 
<2en> after Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its begin@@ nings . 
<2en> compared to Pra@@ gue , Moscow is rather in@@ accessible ; it still remains un@@ usual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own . 
<2en> obvious things , such as giving whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs priority in lif@@ ts , are not com@@ mon@@ place there . 
<2en> fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities . 
<2en> and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ? 
<2en> there are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ... 
<2en> it is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected . 
<2en> in London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious han@@ di@@ cap@@ s to be indepen@@ dently out in public , and they can use the to@@ i@@ lets , go to the mu@@ se@@ um , or wherever ... 
<2en> it is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead ! 
<2en> public respect or accessi@@ bility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous ath@@ le@@ tes , arti@@ sts , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change . 
<2en> so far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong@@ -@@ wi@@ lled . 
<2en> the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what promp@@ ted you in 1998 to form it ? 
<2en> I began my job as a tu@@ tor at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was surro@@ unded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something . 
<2en> since I am a musi@@ ci@@ an myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ op@@ hone - I started a music club with a colleague . 
<2en> with time , as our moder@@ ator L@@ ad@@ ya An@@ gel@@ o@@ vic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( lau@@ gh ) . 
<2en> your popu@@ lar@@ ity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mis@@ taken ? 
<2en> it is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sin@@ gers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band . 
<2en> we realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed . 
<2en> thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tu@@ tors , equipment and so on . 
<2en> was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ ghts ? 
<2en> from the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently . 
<2en> show business is filled with things , where one imi@@ ta@@ tes the other . 
<2en> it is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in h@@ es@@ it@@ an@@ tly and take a long time . 
<2en> things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would d@@ are to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things . 
<2en> a person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ... 
<2en> but that pity is simply was@@ ted , because han@@ di@@ cap@@ ped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ ti@@ ed . 
<2en> they are people , who can fully live life and blo@@ s@@ so@@ m , assu@@ ming , of course , that they have the right environment for it . 
<2en> I say that when a person with a handica@@ p succe@@ eds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole . 
<2en> has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are sug@@ gest@@ ing ? 
<2en> if we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ compromis@@ ing in many things and require a certain level of discipline . 
<2en> I think this is to be expected . 
<2en> some people come to us with a roman@@ tic idea and their head in the cl@@ ou@@ ds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concer@@ ts , their enthusiasm quickly dis@@ appears . 
<2en> that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something . 
<2en> the Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members . 
<2en> how many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ? 
<2en> only one , L@@ ad@@ ya An@@ gel@@ o@@ vic . 
<2en> we are an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avoi@@ dable . 
<2en> those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open . 
<2en> the event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20@@ .@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ p@@ m . 
<2en> the ven@@ ues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ eba , Br@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va P@@ ly@@ no@@ jem with performan@@ ces from 12 ban@@ ds and other musi@@ ci@@ ans from the Czech Republic . 
<2en> all three cities will be joined by a telev@@ ised lin@@ k@@ -@@ up at the evening 's close for a united ren@@ di@@ tion of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p 's an@@ them " The En@@ d of the World is cancel@@ led " 
<2en> the concert 's goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the stu@@ de@@ o multi@@ -@@ fun@@ ctional whe@@ el@@ -@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Pra@@ gue in the sum of 25 million Czech cro@@ wns . 
<2en> admission fe@@ e to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tic@@ kets on sale from B@@ oh@@ emi@@ a@@ tick@@ et . 
<2en> Poland and the Co@@ s@@ mos . 
<2en> last week the coun@@ cil of ministers of the European S@@ pace Agency ad@@ mitted Poland as the twen@@ ti@@ e@@ th member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Blo@@ ck ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the ES@@ A on the 12@@ th of November 2008 ) . 
<2en> Poland began close cooperation with the ES@@ A in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects . 
<2en> of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier . 
<2en> Polish bo@@ ff@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding . 
<2en> I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A Ster@@ n@@ feld in War@@ saw 's as@@ tron@@ om@@ y observ@@ atory , who , on the 6@@ th of December 19@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pion@@ e@@ ering work En@@ try into space . 
<2en> the thoughts of the young engine@@ er ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audi@@ ence cold , and years later Ster@@ n@@ feld remember@@ ed that only D@@ r. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work . 
<2en> in 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , Ster@@ n@@ feld received the Robert Es@@ n@@ au@@ l@@ t@@ -@@ P@@ el@@ terie and An@@ dre Lou@@ is H@@ ir@@ sch pri@@ ze in France . 
<2en> the above mentioned D@@ r. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 196@@ 6 ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of as@@ tron@@ om@@ y and as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics . 
<2en> he published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects . 
<2en> G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a world@@ -@@ known promo@@ ter of as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cra@@ ter on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him . 
<2en> in 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fit@@ ted with a ro@@ cket engine . 
<2en> unfortunately , both the project 's de@@ signer , and the project 's details , are un@@ known . 
<2en> it is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down . 
<2en> information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time . 
<2en> in 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in f@@ lying bom@@ bs . 
<2en> the research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Techn@@ ology Di@@ vision in collaboration with Prof@@ . Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wol@@ f@@ ke and Prof@@ . G@@ us@@ ta@@ w M@@ ok@@ r@@ zy@@ ck@@ i . 
<2en> from the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests . 
<2en> of course , the advance of the German army interrup@@ ted the research . 
<2en> in 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air tor@@ pe@@ do and f@@ lying ro@@ c@@ ket@@ -@@ bom@@ b appeared , auth@@ or@@ ed by Le@@ li@@ w@@ y@@ -@@ K@@ ry@@ w@@ ob@@ lo@@ ck@@ i . 
<2en> both projects were dest@@ ined for military use of ro@@ cket eng@@ ines . 
<2en> immediately prior to the War , all projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Pro@@ visional Sci@@ enti@@ fic Ad@@ vis@@ ory Board ( Ty@@ m@@ c@@ zas@@ ow@@ y Kom@@ itet Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ N@@ au@@ ko@@ w@@ y ) that coordinated all the work . 
<2en> the Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War . 
<2en> further work devoted to as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Pres@@ s after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie To@@ war@@ zy@@ st@@ wo A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ ty@@ c@@ z@@ ne ) . 
<2en> the first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine Problems in 195@@ 4 , in which four in@@ -@@ depth articles are on the subject of as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics . 
<2en> in one of these , by Prof@@ . Su@@ bo@@ to@@ wi@@ c@@ z , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedi@@ cate itself to as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics . 
<2en> at the time , there were already projects under@@ way for artificial satel@@ li@@ tes and it was clear that cos@@ mic research was an emerging sector . 
<2en> from the beginning of 195@@ 6 , the Polish A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 195@@ 1 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member . 
<2en> in the following year , the P@@ TA 's first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ ier@@ z Z@@ aran@@ k@@ ie@@ wi@@ c@@ z ( 19@@ 02 - 195@@ 9 ) was appointed De@@ puty Chairman for the International A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Federation . 
<2en> he served in this capacity until his death in 195@@ 9 . 
<2en> from 195@@ 6 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of me@@ te@@ or@@ ological ro@@ c@@ kets R@@ M ( ra@@ k@@ ie@@ ta Me@@ te@@ or@@ ologi@@ c@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Polish ro@@ cket to enable scientific research . 
<2en> the first R@@ M@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 195@@ 7 and the first launch took place on the 10@@ th of October 195@@ 8 . 
<2en> the ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 me@@ tres , measu@@ red around 80 c@@ m in length and wei@@ gh@@ ed a little under 5 k@@ g . 
<2en> later , the improved R@@ M@@ -@@ 1@@ A version was construc@@ ted and in the summer of 195@@ 9 launch tests were initiated for the two@@ -@@ stage R@@ M@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket in the B@@ le@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert . 
<2en> the ro@@ cket was 1.@@ 4 me@@ tres in length and wei@@ gh@@ ed approximately 11.@@ 5 k@@ g . 
<2en> a further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M@@ -@@ 34 ro@@ cket was to reach 14@@ .@@ 5 km and be task@@ ed with monitoring high al@@ titude win@@ ds . 
<2en> of course , in 196@@ 2 further research was stopped . 
<2en> the success@@ or to the R@@ M ro@@ cket type was the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 196@@ 2 to 19@@ 65 . 
<2en> the ro@@ cket was designed as a two@@ -@@ stage ro@@ cket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.@@ 5 k@@ g . 
<2en> three models were developed ( designa@@ ted Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific appara@@ tus . 
<2en> in the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A ro@@ cket , a space of 0.@@ 4 li@@ tres was available , Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 li@@ tres , and Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 li@@ tres . 
<2en> the maximum al@@ titude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km . 
<2en> between 19@@ 65 and 196@@ 8 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2 was under@@ way in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 19@@ 70 . 
<2en> the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 k@@ g , and was capable of lif@@ ting a useful load of 10 k@@ g to a hei@@ ght of around 60@@ km . 
<2en> subsequently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 3 . 
<2en> Poland 's admission to CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R ( Committee for S@@ pace Research ) in 19@@ 60 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R board two years later . 
<2en> Poland also participated in the Inter@@ ko@@ s@@ mos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satel@@ li@@ tes , and in 197@@ 8 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ w@@ ski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after Vladi@@ mir R@@ em@@ kov . 
<2en> abol@@ ishing the legislation on public works is not the solution . 
<2en> last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works . 
<2en> the resolution caused liv@@ ely public debate . 
<2en> it will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective . 
<2en> liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition . 
<2en> its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves . 
<2en> the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial speculation . 
<2en> due to significant labour cost differences ( sal@@ aries ) there is pressure on prices . 
<2en> on this basis , it should be understood that when a suppli@@ er tries to compete in a commercial tender by impor@@ ting cheap goods , " the ru@@ g is pul@@ led " from under the competition 's prices to cap@@ ture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits . 
<2en> on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . the result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies . 
<2en> since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase . 
<2en> the whole situation is bol@@ ster@@ ed by the busin@@ ess@@ man 's complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would alle@@ vi@@ ate the economi@@ cal and social harm caused in the pursu@@ it of profit . 
<2en> the situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data . 
<2en> the ru@@ th@@ less private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artifici@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attra@@ ct foreign investment . 
<2en> in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards . 
<2en> this oc@@ curs chi@@ ef@@ ly in amendments to existing law . 
<2en> the aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dicta@@ ted by private capital , especially in terms of sal@@ aries . 
<2en> on one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long@@ -@@ term unemployment , on the other , restricted employe@@ e rights in the workplace . 
<2en> this yi@@ elds growing poverty and an increasing vo@@ id between the poor and the rich . 
<2en> in Germany there are already a host of food hand@@ -@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages . 
<2en> the number of these people is already in the millions . 
<2en> in the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it com@@ mon@@ ly oc@@ curs that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage . 
<2en> just such a scandal was revealed in the case of aux@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ desta@@ g . 
<2en> the au@@ ster@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ su@@ red by a catastrophi@@ c drop in living standards to emi@@ gra@@ te as it was in the 19@@ th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the ed@@ ge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment . 
<2en> at this point we have to ask where this may come from ? 
<2en> if it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shi@@ f@@ ted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an , Turkish , Moroc@@ can , E@@ gyp@@ tian , and African labour is still at a fra@@ ction of European wages . 
<2en> this applies to all of Latin America . 
<2en> Liberal theory and the Media in@@ ces@@ san@@ tly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ru@@ in . 
<2en> private capital cru@@ elly insis@@ ts on the vie@@ w@@ point that the State must not intervene in the economy . 
<2en> there@@ upon , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own sel@@ fish ends . 
<2en> here , the answer must be yes . 
<2en> the proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent , and in all states , om@@ ni@@ present lobby . 
<2en> the result is a desper@@ ate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punis@@ hable . 
<2en> in Germany the situation is such that state minis@@ tries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry . 
<2en> these laws are then approved in the Bun@@ desta@@ g . 
<2en> real power does not come from the people as the Wes@@ tern@@ -@@ style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests . 
<2en> it is clear that liber@@ all@@ y@@ -@@ orien@@ ta@@ ted democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by Ap@@ pi@@ an in his work on the Rom@@ an Republic Cris@@ is in the time of C@@ es@@ ar and P@@ om@@ pe@@ i : " the State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force . 
<2en> with bri@@ ber@@ y , illegal acquisi@@ tion of benefits , and with st@@ ones or s@@ words . 
<2en> bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hin@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been b@@ ought " ... " people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole de@@ bac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consu@@ ls .. " .. " T@@ here was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cra@@ cy , and an energe@@ tic man should be elected . " Ap@@ pi@@ an had P@@ om@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was C@@ es@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cra@@ cy perman@@ ently . 
<2en> the conclusion , just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on un@@ scru@@ pul@@ ous tenden@@ cies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole . 
<2en> private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole . 
<2en> the outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented deca@@ dence of the eli@@ te with no attempts whatsoever on deep@@ er reaching reforms . 
<2en> the cau@@ sali@@ ty of the rise of the fas@@ c@@ ist and commun@@ ist regimes should therefore be sought in the mis@@ guided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19@@ th and 20@@ th centuries . 
<2en> the current state of affairs , when we consider the de@@ mise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle . 
<2en> the particularly catastrophi@@ c reality is that the current eli@@ te is completely ignor@@ ing the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already wit@@ n@@ essing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history . 
<2en> the abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term . 
<2en> under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lo@@ wer@@ ing the population 's living standards . 
<2en> this pat@@ tern is thus syste@@ mic . 
<2en> to address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and wea@@ ken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state . 
<2en> Israel : chaos La@@ b . 
<2en> " nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , " from S@@ ting 's Fra@@ gi@@ le , where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refra@@ in is " L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . " 
<2en> " if my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying G@@ ut@@ le Sch@@ nap@@ per , wi@@ fe of Ma@@ yer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ schi@@ ld in 18@@ 49 . 
<2en> the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza stri@@ p , as always , has spar@@ ked a lot of reaction . 
<2en> some stand by Israel , argu@@ ing it has the right to sel@@ f@@ -@@ defence , and Palestinians are por@@ tra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claim@@ ing racism by the Israeli state , claim@@ ing that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Ara@@ bs , and that Israel is a terrorist state . 
<2en> I do not want to d@@ well , in these repeated perio@@ dic wa@@ ves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today 's inhabitants of Israel , including the sel@@ f@@ -@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence . 
<2en> I would like to offer the re@@ a@@ ders a pe@@ ek behind the scen@@ es , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5@@ -@@ year long tension is ser@@ ving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East . 
<2en> some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are deri@@ ved from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history . 
<2en> human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power . 
<2en> in every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a N@@ apo@@ le@@ on . 
<2en> what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path indepen@@ dently , or whether behind their th@@ r@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre@@ -@@ calcu@@ lated goal . 
<2en> we must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not happen in one generation 's lif@@ esp@@ an . 
<2en> among these as@@ tron@@ om@@ i@@ cally rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t ma@@ ster ( whether someone else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds . 
<2en> not much is written about them . 
<2en> understan@@ da@@ bly . 
<2en> the first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) they b@@ ought in the 90 's of the 19@@ th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both . 
<2en> they hold majority sta@@ kes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the ass@@ ault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ da@@ fi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) . 
<2en> wh@@ o@@ ever attemp@@ ted to def@@ y this family died . 
<2en> Ab@@ ra@@ ham Lin@@ col@@ n refused to rene@@ w the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ schi@@ ld Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is sta@@ te@@ -@@ issued ) money and was assassin@@ ated in 18@@ 65 at the the@@ a@@ tre . 
<2en> J@@ F@@ K began issu@@ ing his own money and wanted to close the F@@ ed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 196@@ 3 , Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Lou@@ is Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was pois@@ on@@ ed in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the F@@ ed for causing the Great De@@ pression of 19@@ 29 . 
<2en> their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the formulation of a thre@@ e@@ -@@ world@@ -@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d degree , Al@@ bert Pi@@ ke . 
<2en> the first war was to remove the large mon@@ archi@@ c state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.@@ 5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will su@@ ffi@@ ce for their com@@ fort and lu@@ x@@ ury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ecu@@ men@@ ism is just an ap@@ peti@@ ser for this solution ) , and finally the se@@ iz@@ ing of absolute power . 
<2en> the method , which the group of we@@ al@@ thy families with the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds leading the way , emplo@@ y is the in@@ sti@@ gation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab cha@@ o - order from chaos ) . 
<2en> these solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the F@@ ed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 0@@ 7 would not be repeated ) . 
<2en> thus , having succeeded in assassin@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Hab@@ s@@ burg hei@@ r to the Aus@@ tro@@ -@@ Hungarian th@@ r@@ one , in Sar@@ a@@ jevo thereby un@@ le@@ as@@ hing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ she@@ vi@@ k revolution . 
<2en> the First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , mili@@ tari@@ ly and economically un@@ substan@@ tiated , with German capit@@ u@@ lation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a@@ -@@ Hungary were subsequently disman@@ t@@ led . 
<2en> to facilitate the in@@ ception of the Second World War , they allowed ban@@ kers and politicians to create a la@@ tent conflict situation by sa@@ d@@ dl@@ ing Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the im@@ pover@@ ished mass@@ es , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convin@@ cing cul@@ pr@@ it and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi@@ -@@ ra@@ cial Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ va@@ kia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth col@@ ony , once the war had been ign@@ ited . 
<2en> at the end of the 19@@ th C@@ ent@@ ury , the Roth@@ sch@@ il@@ ds in@@ sti@@ ga@@ ted the establishment of the Zi@@ on@@ ist movement , one bran@@ ch of which stro@@ ve to form the Je@@ wish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Re@@ turn to Zi@@ on ) . 
<2en> the a@@ fore@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Je@@ ws to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population . 
<2en> terrorist attacks occurred on both sides . 
<2en> World War II bro@@ ke out , and whether Hit@@ ler bro@@ ke free from the le@@ as@@ h , which international ban@@ kers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Je@@ ws in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the Je@@ wish State . 
<2en> Israel was officially formed in 19@@ 48 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's ho@@ t@@ bed . 
<2en> provided the international ban@@ kers succeed , the Je@@ wish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Ara@@ bi@@ c - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East . 
<2en> Israel is like a huge labor@@ atory , a source of dis@@ cord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) . 
<2en> who is the wron@@ g@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palest@@ ine@@ -@@ Israel conflict , where injustice bre@@ eds injustice in an en@@ dless cycle of violence , while everything began from the gre@@ ed of a few and their lus@@ t for global power ? 
<2en> here , we must differ@@ enti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international ban@@ kers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for . 
<2en> Israel 's current prime minister , Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ u ' the ha@@ w@@ k ' , is a typical example of a fas@@ c@@ ist politici@@ an , loy@@ al to the international ban@@ kers , who does everything to in@@ sti@@ gate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Stra@@ it , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sa@@ il ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy . 
<2en> in what light stand the words , spoken by David R@@ oc@@ ke@@ f@@ eller in 1994 : " all we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Or@@ der . " 
<2en> the New World Or@@ der in their eyes is one of ma@@ ster and sla@@ ve . 
<2en> a world where the rest of the human population serve the lu@@ x@@ ury of a hand@@ ful of financial ar@@ isto@@ cra@@ ts . 
<2en> a world , where each new@@ -@@ born is implan@@ ted with a chi@@ p , which makes their existence completely sub@@ ju@@ ga@@ ted . 
<2en> " he also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and sla@@ ve , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name . 
<2en> if anyone has in@@ sight , let him calcu@@ late the number of the be@@ ast , 
<2en> for it is man 's number . his number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . " 
<2en> Ar@@ go : when things are at their worst - call Hol@@ ly@@ wood . 
<2en> in November 197@@ 9 , a mo@@ b of Islamic stu@@ dent demonstra@@ tors took over the American emb@@ ass@@ y in T@@ eh@@ ran and held 52 diplom@@ ats ho@@ stage . 
<2en> they were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thro@@ wn Sha@@ h Mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Re@@ za P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who fle@@ d after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades . 
<2en> for the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ board , because this would seriously jeopar@@ dise the trust of other al@@ lied countries . 
<2en> the release of the ho@@ stages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ oc@@ ratic regime , could not be achieved . 
<2en> this was a b@@ low to the pres@@ tige of the United States , which was later com@@ po@@ unded by the fi@@ as@@ co of attempting to free the ho@@ stages by force . 
<2en> the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated diplom@@ ats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Alger@@ ian government . 
<2en> their or@@ deal provo@@ ked a wave of solidarity and anti@@ -@@ Iranian feelings at home . 
<2en> the de@@ bac@@ le in Iran significantly influen@@ ced J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter 's loss with R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an in the 1980 presidential elections . 
<2en> the film Ar@@ go , directed by the ac@@ tor B@@ en A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck , re@@ coun@@ ts one ep@@ is@@ ode in this story , which brought America a small victory . 
<2en> just before the emb@@ ass@@ y was se@@ ized , six employees esca@@ ped . 
<2en> after some peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , they ended up in the Can@@ adi@@ an ambassa@@ dor 's residence . 
<2en> the CIA , in collaboration with the Can@@ adi@@ an authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Can@@ adi@@ an pass@@ ports as members of a film cre@@ w , who were sur@@ ve@@ ying lo@@ cations for a sci@@ -@@ fi block@@ bus@@ ter . 
<2en> a combination of gen@@ res 
<2en> the plan , con@@ cei@@ ved by " ex@@ fil@@ tration " expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hol@@ ly@@ wood . 
<2en> for the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in speci@@ alist ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , press confer@@ ences were organised , and the ficti@@ tious production company had a real office . 
<2en> the details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film dra@@ ws on the mem@@ ories of Tony Men@@ dez . 
<2en> A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck 's film is a pe@@ culi@@ ar mix of gen@@ res . 
<2en> on one hand , there is a realistic in@@ c@@ isi@@ ve political th@@ ri@@ ller , and at the same time a " ca@@ per mo@@ vie , " with small vic@@ tories and dou@@ ble@@ -@@ cross@@ ing - another example would be O@@ ce@@ an 's E@@ lev@@ en . 
<2en> the mo@@ od alterna@@ tes in the film - on one side , shar@@ p docu@@ mentar@@ y@@ -@@ style sequ@@ ences in T@@ eh@@ ran ( the title sequ@@ ence shows i@@ con@@ ic pho@@ tos from news of the time , relating to the same events por@@ tra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) . 
<2en> on the other hand , li@@ ghter sections from Hol@@ ly@@ wood , la@@ ced with ir@@ ony and a little exag@@ ger@@ ation . 
<2en> then there are scen@@ es from the CIA head@@ quarters and other agencies - men in su@@ its debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corri@@ dors , over the phone ... 
<2en> B@@ en A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck has managed to res@@ tar@@ t his career in extraordinary style . 
<2en> the deri@@ ded ac@@ tor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ir@@ on@@ ic comments . 
<2en> Ar@@ go is his third big@@ -@@ screen mo@@ vie , following his dar@@ k crime mo@@ vie G@@ one B@@ aby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the th@@ ri@@ ller The T@@ own ( 2010 ) . 
<2en> it is also A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's hom@@ e@@ town of Bo@@ st@@ on . 
<2en> the atmosp@@ her@@ ic feel in different lo@@ cations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier fil@@ ms above Hol@@ ly@@ wood standards . 
<2en> A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go , where T@@ eh@@ ran is " fea@@ tured " by Canada . 
<2en> the best scen@@ es of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequ@@ ence of the sie@@ ge on the emb@@ ass@@ y is impres@@ sively lu@@ ci@@ d , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come floo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes a turn . 
<2en> a similar effect is achieved by A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck and his team in the ficti@@ tious scen@@ es ( the fa@@ ke staff at the T@@ eh@@ ran ba@@ za@@ ar ) . 
<2en> too much action in too many places 
<2en> the director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many na@@ il@@ -@@ bit@@ ing scen@@ es for the film . 
<2en> what little there is , is worked well , with some occasion@@ al emb@@ ell@@ is@@ h@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so ele@@ gan@@ tly ( the scene , where a lo@@ om@@ ing crisis is aver@@ ted at T@@ eh@@ ran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a ch@@ ase on the run@@ way seems quite far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched ) . 
<2en> Ar@@ go 's weak@@ ness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places . 
<2en> A@@ lan Ar@@ kin and John Go@@ od@@ man play their ro@@ les as the Hol@@ ly@@ wood assistants with great char@@ m ; their charac@@ ters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film . 
<2en> A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck 's film lo@@ ses the dramatic pu@@ ll a little , it is a film , which can be wat@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are e@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive of th@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 's . 
<2en> it does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate . 
<2en> as a remin@@ der of history 's particular ways and a testi@@ mon@@ y to how exag@@ ger@@ ated the views are on the all@@ -@@ powerful all@@ -@@ controlling secret services , this will do . 
<2en> rules for b@@ low@@ ing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for ban@@ anas and a circu@@ s 
<2en> the www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server , which issues a po@@ ll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announ@@ ce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . " 
<2en> " we were promp@@ ted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " Patri@@ k Nach@@ er , the po@@ ll 's organiser , told Pra@@ vo . 
<2en> among the latest nomin@@ ated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premi@@ ums for men and women . 
<2en> until now , women were favou@@ red in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insur@@ ers . 
<2en> " other un@@ belie@@ vable ideas from the EU can be nomin@@ ated by anyone until the end of the year . 
<2en> the actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , " informed Nach@@ er . 
<2en> among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio@@ -@@ ingre@@ di@@ ents to fuel , which consequently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mercury ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chi@@ cken ca@@ ges , which significantly raised eg@@ g prices this year . 
<2en> the ban on the use of the term " spre@@ ada@@ ble bu@@ tter " and the withdrawal of classi@@ c light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism . 
<2en> first rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 cen@@ time@@ tres 
<2en> the Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lob@@ b@@ ying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defen@@ ded by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being ve@@ to@@ ed ) . 
<2en> the lobby 's interests were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 c@@ m in the EU , and were not to display and " an@@ om@@ al@@ ous cur@@ vat@@ ure . " 
<2en> the European Commission defen@@ ded itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading . 
<2en> nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vege@@ tables have already been sof@@ ten@@ ed by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives . 
<2en> one possible pri@@ ze@@ -@@ win@@ ner in the po@@ ll may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which inf@@ la@@ table bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inf@@ late them without par@@ ental supervision . 
<2en> here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ o@@ cation . 
<2en> a similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wers . 
<2en> strange ideas are con@@ cei@@ ved at home too 
<2en> fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m F@@ Y@@ RO@@ M ( For@@ mer Yugosla@@ v Republic of Macedonia ) should be used . 
<2en> the Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal E@@ conom@@ ist Association , La@@ is@@ sez F@@ aire , also nomin@@ ated , aside from the a@@ fore@@ mentioned absur@@ di@@ ties , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state . 
<2en> the EU stipu@@ lated the maximum volu@@ mes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union . 
<2en> the Czech Republic there@@ after exce@@ eded , for instance , the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room preser@@ ves , which incur@@ red a high penalty . 
<2en> the po@@ ll 's organis@@ ers were also impres@@ sed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a co@@ ast@@ line , or the suggestion of allo@@ cating funding for a request for funding . 
<2en> these ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Pra@@ gue . 
<2en> " we are han@@ di@@ cap@@ ped because we do not have the sea . 
<2en> we are asking the European Union for a ref@@ und , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jar@@ os@@ la@@ v Pal@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) . 
<2en> his argument was that there had been a good har@@ v@@ est of cere@@ als , and due to the so@@ -@@ called bu@@ y@@ -@@ out interventions , the state 's war@@ eh@@ ou@@ ses were full and were forced to export . 
<2en> the Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s . 
<2en> the European Commission finally met the CR hal@@ f@@ way by organis@@ ing a tender for the purchase of cere@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea . 
<2en> funding to subsi@@ dise funding requests was offered to for@@ eign@@ ers by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ em@@ e@@ c ( US@@ -@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels . 
<2en> EU : bi@@ zar@@ re legislation is the exception 
<2en> regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts . 
<2en> a more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pus@@ hed through by member states during a budget meeting . 
<2en> emo@@ tions fl@@ are among Cze@@ chs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed . 
<2en> the Cze@@ chs fought for six years with the Ger@@ man@@ s and Austri@@ ans to protect the labelling of their ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ uz@@ ky , however the tu@@ zem@@ sky ru@@ m , whose tradition reach@@ es back to the 19@@ th century here , had to be ren@@ am@@ ed Tu@@ zem@@ ak by the manufacturers . 
<2en> the appel@@ lation of ru@@ m can only be given to products dis@@ til@@ led from can@@ e sugar , and not sugar be@@ et . 
<2en> Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , P@@ oh@@ or@@ eli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hop@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world@@ -@@ ren@@ owned fe@@ ta che@@ ese and g@@ org@@ on@@ zo@@ la , German mar@@ zi@@ pan from Lu@@ be@@ ck , and Par@@ ma ham . 
<2en> the EU 's sta@@ mp of protection can also be prou@@ dly shown on Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce g@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad and H@@ ori@@ cky tu@@ bes . 
<2en> people want me to save the re@@ public , but I am an ama@@ teur , says Ok@@ am@@ ura 
<2en> Sen@@ ator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ? 
<2en> this is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president . 
<2en> if everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post . 
<2en> I cannot watch any longer the country having been ro@@ b@@ bed over the past twenty years , th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ aming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing . 
<2en> I had no ambition to be a politici@@ an . 
<2en> when I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things . 
<2en> since I have already turned for@@ ty , and I am an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president . 
<2en> you have already reached the Sen@@ ate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the C@@ ast@@ le . 
<2en> are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ? 
<2en> I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the C@@ ast@@ le based on the results in the Sen@@ ate 's elections . 
<2en> later , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president . 
<2en> my goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised . 
<2en> therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strong@@ est mandate possible . 
<2en> the trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tra@@ mp@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things . 
<2en> the Media add to this , mis@@ leading the public , and mis@@ taking freedom of speech with freedom to lie . 
<2en> for example , I was alle@@ ge@@ dly bri@@ bing repor@@ ters , or I was alle@@ ge@@ dly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k . 
<2en> let 's talk about your vision . 
<2en> you set out on your ca@@ st@@ le sie@@ ge with a th@@ es@@ is on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial dis@@ closure of assets over twenty million . 
<2en> you need to change the law for this . 
<2en> as president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Sen@@ ate as a whole may propose laws . 
<2en> how are you going to solve this ? 
<2en> when I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through . 
<2en> the problem is political squ@@ ab@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliber@@ ately rejected , causing delays for the public . 
<2en> as an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides . 
<2en> the advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it . 
<2en> do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ? 
<2en> from the Czech vie@@ w@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left . 
<2en> for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right . 
<2en> the important part for me is moving forward . 
<2en> it is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together . 
<2en> I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ S@@ C@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas . 
<2en> you get an@@ gr@@ y when someone calls you a popu@@ list . 
<2en> are you not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated ? 
<2en> when you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision . 
<2en> you try to come close to it . 
<2en> some may call it popu@@ lis@@ m , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts . 
<2en> but without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slo@@ gan@@ s . 
<2en> you will not last long in politics with that . 
<2en> or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ? 
<2en> I have no alternative . 
<2en> I need to convince politicians , repor@@ ters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through . 
<2en> if I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arran@@ ge a live television broad@@ cast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil serv@@ ants , judges , and the At@@ tor@@ ney General . 
<2en> and , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this . 
<2en> when there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene . 
<2en> take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure . 
<2en> I will say frankly that I am an ama@@ teur , I am not a geni@@ us or an intellectual . 
<2en> I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision . 
<2en> I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda . 
<2en> I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector . 
<2en> it so@@ unds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic . 
<2en> I am no sa@@ vi@@ our . 
<2en> I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate . 
<2en> I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cur@@ a , who decl@@ ined due to his work@@ load . 
<2en> so I , at least , support investiga@@ tive journ@@ alist , J@@ ana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ va , who un@@ covered frau@@ du@@ lent activity with light he@@ ating oil . 
<2en> I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ conten@@ ted , but now I have my doubts . 
<2en> six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment . 
<2en> in the sen@@ ate , there are only two indepen@@ dents , including me . 
<2en> people have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes . 
<2en> nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional coun@@ cil presiden@@ ts . 
<2en> are you considering having your own party ? 
<2en> I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to veri@@ fy that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it . 
<2en> I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand . 
<2en> you have no money ? 
<2en> you are talking about financial dis@@ clo@@ s@@ ures , but what is y@@ ours like ? 
<2en> I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million . 
<2en> in Pra@@ gue , I have land worth around 25 million , an a@@ partment worth ten million , another a@@ partment worth eight million , an ar@@ t@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ st@@ on Martin worth 3.@@ 5 million , a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account . 
<2en> I have the A@@ st@@ on Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a bo@@ y - I always liked J@@ ames Bon@@ d , who dro@@ ve the car , was g@@ allant with women and also fought against evil and villa@@ iny . 
<2en> you drive an A@@ st@@ on Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ? 
<2en> you say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it . 
<2en> this does not inspi@@ re much confidence . 
<2en> I do not have 15 million for a campaign . 
<2en> should I take out a lo@@ an ? 
<2en> I have already put 2.@@ 5 million into the campaign . 
<2en> the fact that I do not have any spon@@ sors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme . 
<2en> I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign . 
<2en> the expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator . 
<2en> however , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month . 
<2en> if I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election . 
<2en> so you will still be in business so that you can make a living ? 
<2en> did you not say you would be putting this on hold ? 
<2en> this depends on the rate of pay . 
<2en> as I promised , my activities have been parti@@ ally reduced . 
<2en> for example , my de@@ puty is taking over as the CE@@ O of the travel agency in spring . 
<2en> people would like me to be a Sam@@ ari@@ tan , who sa@@ ves the Republic . 
<2en> but I must also live off something . 
<2en> as a busin@@ ess@@ man , what would you usually make mon@@ thly ? 
<2en> two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do . 
<2en> and if I became president , then I would end my business activity . 
<2en> the full inter@@ view can be read in Sat@@ ur@@ day 's issue of Pra@@ vo . 
<2en> the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architec@@ ts prove that true ad@@ vent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently er@@ ec@@ ted Bü@@ cher@@ berg ( liter@@ ally " book mountain " ) - 2 pho@@ tos 
<2en> " I think the building is f@@ un , looks futur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , " said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g , a pas@@ ser@@ -@@ by at the ro@@ ad@@ -@@ side . 
<2en> and Ste@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , IT techni@@ ci@@ an in a major firm based near@@ by commen@@ ted : " it 's definitely a thing of beau@@ ty , the building . " 
<2en> however , I do wonder why people would need another libr@@ ary in this day and age . 
<2en> everyone has the Internet , an i@@ P@@ ad and e@@ Bo@@ o@@ ks . 
<2en> no@@ -@@ one goes into one of these ol@@ d@@ -@@ style libr@@ aries voluntari@@ ly nowadays , or am I wrong ? 
<2en> Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the ga@@ tes of Ro@@ tter@@ dam , which bar@@ ely mer@@ its a visit , is a special rec@@ ord@@ -@@ hol@@ der . 
<2en> the 8@@ 0,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ resi@@ dent munici@@ pa@@ lity has the lowest liter@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands . 
<2en> in order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to rec@@ re@@ ate the seven ficti@@ tious bri@@ dges that feature on the Euro notes as pre@@ tty , pain@@ ted reinforced concrete mini@@ at@@ ures . 
<2en> the success of the education offensive was limited . 
<2en> and so the city fa@@ thers acknowledged that there was only one way to become ma@@ ster over the statistics : a libr@@ ary had to be built ! 
<2en> Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Ro@@ tter@@ dam@@ -@@ based architec@@ tural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , ma@@ ster of auda@@ ci@@ ous bar char@@ ts and producer of hu@@ mor@@ ous and often cyni@@ cal buildings , took the project on with his custom@@ ary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face . 
<2en> and with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ wi@@ l@@ der@@ ment , sh@@ ru@@ g@@ ging their shoul@@ ders , the im@@ pertinent Ma@@ as sta@@ cked his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a py@@ ra@@ mid and ro@@ unded off his presentation - now sui@@ tably backed up with action - with the words : " dear M@@ uni@@ ci@@ pa@@ lity ! " 
<2en> so this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Bo@@ ok Mo@@ un@@ tain - for the so@@ -@@ called Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg ! 
<2en> nine years later , the 30@@ -@@ milli@@ on@@ -@@ euro mountain has been lif@@ ted up . 
<2en> it is part of a re@@ vit@@ alisation project , which also includes an under@@ ground car par@@ k , a super@@ market , a post office and a small number of ad@@ jac@@ ent a@@ partment buildings and terra@@ ced houses , with a total of 50 d@@ w@@ ell@@ ings . 
<2en> at the beginning of November , the Bü@@ cher@@ berg was awarded second place in the " B@@ est Li@@ br@@ ary of NL 2012 " competition . 
<2en> in addition , the project is also nomin@@ ated for the Dutch National Wo@@ od A@@ ward 2012 . 
<2en> thus , the fac@@ eless sm@@ all@@ -@@ town re@@ tort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post@@ -@@ modern pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an area and a st@@ un@@ ning@@ ly ug@@ ly town h@@ all , behind whose white fac@@ a@@ des one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ ster@@ ed by a piece of con@@ temporary architecture . 
<2en> first and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence . 
<2en> the long journey to the book 
<2en> the first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books bene@@ ath a che@@ ese dom@@ e . 
<2en> there is in fact a li@@ ft that cli@@ m@@ bs through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and liter@@ at@@ ure are revealed when s@@ cal@@ ing the to@@ po@@ graphy on foot . 
<2en> the interior space , gla@@ zed throughout , is b@@ right and open , the fi@@ red cl@@ in@@ ker flo@@ ors and the ele@@ g@@ ant street la@@ mp@@ s speak the un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able language of a public town squ@@ are . 
<2en> the urban ambi@@ ance is perfect . 
<2en> you are already on the lo@@ ok@@ out for a par@@ k ben@@ ch , a do@@ g , and bo@@ ys and girls playing football . 
<2en> and everywhere there are books , books , books . 
<2en> " normally book sh@@ el@@ ves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dar@@ k space , which is usually un@@ pleas@@ ant and im@@ personal , " says Win@@ y Ma@@ as . 
<2en> we turned the classi@@ cal spa@@ tial configu@@ ration on its head and turned the reading area inside out . 
<2en> the interior of the Bü@@ cher@@ berg is cle@@ ver@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet libr@@ ary , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room . 
<2en> one particularly special feature are the black book sh@@ el@@ ves , which simultane@@ ously act as wall cla@@ d@@ ding , para@@ pe@@ ts and rail@@ ings for the sta@@ ir@@ way . 
<2en> the appearance , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign . 
<2en> even di@@ e@@ -@@ hard architec@@ ts and construction engine@@ ers sha@@ ke their heads at the un@@ known construction materials . 
<2en> " here we wanted to work with recycla@@ ble materials , " explained Jo@@ o@@ p T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st , Pro@@ ject Man@@ ager for the M@@ uni@@ ci@@ pa@@ lity of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standar@@ d . 
<2en> and thus one day we st@@ um@@ bled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fr@@ isi@@ an farm . 
<2en> for many years , milli@@ me@@ tre@@ -@@ thi@@ ck artificial fabri@@ c has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base la@@ yer . 
<2en> it is in@@ expensive and sa@@ ves time . 
<2en> the thin textile last@@ s for two seas@@ ons and is then dis@@ posed of as bul@@ k waste . 
<2en> for the libr@@ ary , the fabri@@ c was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four@@ -@@ cen@@ time@@ tre@@ -@@ thi@@ ck bo@@ ards . 
<2en> under he@@ at and pressure , the so@@ -@@ called Land@@ bou@@ w pla@@ stic ( K@@ L@@ P ) changes col@@ our to a dar@@ k , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robus@@ t material , that sm@@ ells like a mix@@ ture of new car sm@@ ell and the sm@@ ell of tra@@ in@@ ers . 
<2en> after 10@@ 5 steps you have reached the summit . 
<2en> at the end of the 5@@ 00@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long journey , you are re@@ war@@ ded in the L@@ iter@@ at@@ ure C@@ af@@ é , not only with a fanta@@ stic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ ettes and po@@ t@@ ted fi@@ cus tre@@ es . 
<2en> these provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air hu@@ mi@@ dity in the liter@@ ary mountain range . 
<2en> don@@ ations for the new sou@@ l 
<2en> " you would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many gla@@ ss pan@@ els , is a sho@@ w@@ case project in the area of ec@@ ology , " said T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st . 
<2en> it is he@@ ated and co@@ o@@ led using geo@@ ther@@ mal he@@ at . 
<2en> although the Bü@@ cher@@ berg has a gla@@ ss cover , the su@@ n only sh@@ ines only briefly into the interior , even on sun@@ ny days . 
<2en> the broad , la@@ min@@ ated wood g@@ lu@@ e be@@ ams posi@@ tion@@ ed at ri@@ ght@@ -@@ ang@@ les to the gla@@ ss fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absor@@ b the majority of the sun@@ light . 
<2en> the in@@ door temperat@@ ure is very pleas@@ ant . 
<2en> the rest is taken care of by fully automatic ro@@ ller blin@@ ds . 
<2en> Ste@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , initially a scep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already ventu@@ red into the new libr@@ ary . 
<2en> Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g has also visited already . 
<2en> so too has T@@ C@@ M@@ -@@ teach@@ er , Cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia Bo@@ garde , who even refers to the Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse 's " long over@@ due sou@@ l . " 
<2en> the reason : at the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to don@@ ate a book from his / her personal collection . 
<2en> this was , for the time being , to fill the op@@ tical gaps in the not yet fully sto@@ cked libr@@ ary - currently there are 7@@ 0@@ ,000 items . 
<2en> the concept has been a success . 
<2en> the sh@@ el@@ ves are full to capacity . 
<2en> " nothing is worse than a hal@@ f@@ -@@ empty libr@@ ary , " said architec@@ t Win@@ y Ma@@ as . 
<2en> " I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resi@@ dent now has a certain bon@@ d with this new building . 
<2en> everyone knows that their book is part of the building . 
<2en> even if it 's just for de@@ cor@@ ation . 
<2en> as such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ ster@@ ing the ma@@ ster discipline that speci@@ alist j@@ ar@@ g@@ on refers to as the formation of identity . 
<2en> Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written liter@@ ary history . 
<2en> however young and un@@ edu@@ cated it may be . 
<2en> this is ultimately a starting point for identity . 
<2en> S@@ zab@@ o : " Ger@@ man@@ s must play a greater role " 
<2en> in the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting . 
<2en> according to Ste@@ p@@ hen S@@ zab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US@@ -@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is wal@@ king a thin diplomatic line . 
<2en> Deut@@ sche W@@ elle : at the beginning of the week , Germany had initially sign@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for observer status within the United Nations . 
<2en> however , Berlin subsequently abstained from voting . 
<2en> why ? 
<2en> Ste@@ p@@ hen S@@ zab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza . 
<2en> now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cau@@ tious . 
<2en> at the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either . 
<2en> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel . 
<2en> during the u@@ pris@@ ing in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no@@ -@@ f@@ ly zone . 
<2en> this was ultimately implemented by NATO . 
<2en> does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ? 
<2en> Y@@ es , it does . 
<2en> that is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy . 
<2en> this situation is aggra@@ va@@ ted by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardis@@ ed policy . 
<2en> the Ger@@ man@@ s thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts . 
<2en> it is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to . 
<2en> I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a " more normal " foreign policy . 
<2en> a foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain . 
<2en> so what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy enta@@ il , from a German perspective ? 
<2en> it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners . 
<2en> I believe that the German foreign policy is motiv@@ ated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Ne@@ ar East . 
<2en> Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests . 
<2en> have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Ne@@ ar East conflict and their voting in the UN ? 
<2en> on the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Ne@@ ar East , and particularly in the G@@ ulf States . 
<2en> therefore it must be careful not to af@@ front the public , but also the eli@@ te in the Ara@@ bi@@ c countries . 
<2en> in any case , this plays a role . 
<2en> however , I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . this is not an entirely on@@ e@@ -@@ si@@ ded relationship . 
<2en> nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's considerations . 
<2en> has Germany dama@@ ged its relations with the USA , by absta@@ ining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ? 
<2en> I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position preva@@ ils . 
<2en> therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fra@@ cture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya . 
<2en> perhaps it will even ear@@ n Germany a certain degree of respect . 
<2en> after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered . 
<2en> in Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative . 
<2en> the USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto . 
<2en> are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ? 
<2en> due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed . 
<2en> I think that secre@@ tly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation . 
<2en> however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly . 
<2en> it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear . 
<2en> if you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Ne@@ tan@@ jah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Ne@@ tan@@ jah@@ u 's policies . 
<2en> does Germany find it difficult to reconci@@ le its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ? 
<2en> I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Ger@@ man@@ s . 
<2en> it would of course be a little simp@@ ler for the Ger@@ man@@ s if there were a coherent and standardis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case . 
<2en> thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position . 
<2en> this is precisely what they are doing with the Euro . 
<2en> I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in ur@@ ging Europe towards a standardis@@ ed European position . 
<2en> this is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel . 
<2en> this has always been a sensitive subject . 
<2en> yet I do think that Ger@@ man@@ s are clear that they must play a more independent role . 
<2en> does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ? 
<2en> or does Germany still find leadership ro@@ les difficult ? 
<2en> Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be un@@ comfor@@ table and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more pro@@ minent role . 
<2en> if we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assu@@ mes a more pro@@ minent role , various anti@@ -@@ German feelings become apparent . 
<2en> this does not make matters simple for the Ger@@ man@@ s . 
<2en> this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surro@@ unded by hosti@@ le countries . 
<2en> from this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA . 
<2en> it must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy . 
<2en> the influence of the USA over European politics is continu@@ ally di@@ minis@@ hing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vac@@ u@@ um , so who is fi@@ lling the gap ? 
<2en> the Ger@@ man@@ s will simply have to play a greater role . 
<2en> even if they do not like it , even if it is un@@ comfor@@ table and makes them even more un@@ popular - c '@@ est la vie ! 
<2en> Ste@@ p@@ hen S@@ zab@@ o is associ@@ ate director of the Transa@@ tlan@@ tic A@@ ca@@ de@@ my in Washington , an institu@@ te in which acade@@ mi@@ cs and political experts from Europe and North America come together to research the challenges of the transatlantic community . 
<2en> S@@ zab@@ o is also a member of the German Mar@@ shall Fund , in which he has speci@@ alised in German policy , US foreign policy and transatlantic relations . 
<2en> " br@@ and protection " in China : when Pu@@ ma and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese 
<2en> Ar@@ man@@ i is a world@@ -@@ famous br@@ and , Pol@@ o R@@ al@@ p@@ h L@@ au@@ ren likewise . 
<2en> however , what is Ar@@ man@@ i Pol@@ o ? 
<2en> behind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered br@@ and in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies . 
<2en> nonetheless , it is enjo@@ ying protection , provided the actual cre@@ ators of the names do not su@@ e . 
<2en> and even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights . 
<2en> " it is becoming increasingly more difficult for for@@ eign@@ ers to protect their bran@@ ds in China , " said Thom@@ as Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch , law@@ yer within the T@@ ay@@ l@@ or W@@ essing law firm , who speci@@ alis@@ es in copyright infringement in the F@@ ar East . 
<2en> every week a new case lands on my des@@ k . 
<2en> all the cop@@ y@@ ca@@ ts require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their bran@@ ds . 
<2en> thus Gu@@ c@@ ci simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gu@@ c@@ ci , Pra@@ da@@ -@@ K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da . 
<2en> German companies are also ' legally ' cop@@ ied in this manner , such as manufac@@ turer of spor@@ ting appar@@ el , Pu@@ ma . 
<2en> Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch opens a file containing registra@@ tions with the tra@@ de@@ mark office in Pe@@ king . 
<2en> on 14 September 2010 a Chinese company cop@@ y@@ ri@@ ghted the br@@ and name Ze@@ gna D@@ F Pu@@ ma there , an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion re@@ tail@@ er Er@@ men@@ e@@ gi@@ l@@ do Ze@@ gna . 
<2en> the fact that the Chinese are world cham@@ pi@@ ons in cop@@ ying and infr@@ ing@@ ing on intellectual property is w@@ ell@@ -@@ known . 
<2en> in the major cities there are multi@@ -@@ level de@@ partment st@@ ores that sell counterfe@@ it goods almost exclusively . 
<2en> Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the tra@@ de@@ mark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere . 
<2en> the Chinese call this " Ban@@ g M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , " a passenger br@@ and . 
<2en> the word is based on " Ban@@ g D@@ ak@@ u@@ an . " 
<2en> this refers to women who la@@ tch onto rich men . 
<2en> the Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wron@@ g@@ doing . 
<2en> " this har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , " challenges Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch . 
<2en> " the br@@ and is wa@@ tered down , its uni@@ qu@@ eness dis@@ appears - the image damage is enormous . " 
<2en> the financial losses and process costs of the affected bran@@ ches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive fla@@ g@@ ship products . 
<2en> according to information from market research company C@@ L@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annu@@ ally , China is the third largest market for lu@@ x@@ ury items , and the fa@@ st@@ est growing . 
<2en> however , the dele@@ tion of du@@ bi@@ ous en@@ tries in the tra@@ de@@ mark regis@@ try are difficult to achieve , and cost a pre@@ tty pen@@ ny . 
<2en> the process can last for up to nine years , with an un@@ certain outcome . 
<2en> Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ mis@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a " market reality . " 
<2en> if the compla@@ in@@ ant is un@@ lu@@ cky , he may even have to pay the pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist money for having infrin@@ ged on his tra@@ de@@ mark in China , said Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch . 
<2en> sometimes the law of the j@@ ung@@ le preva@@ ils here . 
<2en> famous cases also relate to graphic elements . 
<2en> in 2009 , D@@ aim@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction ma@@ chin@@ ery manufac@@ turer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pu@@ mp manufac@@ turer P@@ utz@@ meis@@ ter . 
<2en> even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that res@@ emb@@ les the Mer@@ ce@@ des star . 
<2en> Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purch@@ as@@ er Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that res@@ em@@ bled the B@@ M@@ W logo ; the dispute was arbitra@@ ted and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it . 
<2en> fashion house L@@ aco@@ ste lost a suit in China against cop@@ y@@ ca@@ ts from Hong Kong and Sing@@ apor@@ e , who were using the famous cro@@ codi@@ le looking in the other direction . 
<2en> the Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wron@@ g@@ doing . 
<2en> the C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ de@@ mark office in Pe@@ king does acknowledge that there were bot@@ tl@@ en@@ ec@@ ks in 2010 due to limited sta@@ ff@@ ing and equipment . 
<2en> in the past year , however , things repor@@ tedly " returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . " 
<2en> thus the stock of un@@ proces@@ sed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent . 
<2en> almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such ca@@ sed were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year . 
<2en> nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appe@@ als waiting to be resolved in the office . 
<2en> to remedy this is very expensive 
<2en> as is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing . 
<2en> in the past year , more than 1.@@ 4 million applications for tra@@ de@@ mark protection were submitted to the C@@ T@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 . 
<2en> this is a record and means that China , for the ten@@ th time in succes@@ sion , is the global leader when it comes to new tra@@ de@@ mark applications , informed the authority . 
<2en> the same applies for the invent@@ ory of valid tra@@ de@@ marks , tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in number . 
<2en> in 2011 , 1.@@ 8 billion y@@ u@@ an in fe@@ es were received . 
<2en> put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 2@@ 80 y@@ u@@ an , or 1@@ 60 euros . 
<2en> to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg . 
<2en> for more than seven years , the group has been cont@@ esting against a Chinese pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist . 
<2en> the Ger@@ man@@ s did in fact manage to ex@@ pose the company 's illegal manufacturing of cop@@ ied motor vehicle parts . 
<2en> however , the cop@@ y@@ cat still secu@@ red the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg br@@ and . 
<2en> this is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Han@@ no W@@ entz@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg Chemi@@ cal Spe@@ ci@@ ali@@ ties in Mun@@ ich . 
<2en> the C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ de@@ mark office then also dis@@ missed the Mun@@ ich@@ -@@ based company 's appeal . 
<2en> in the next two instances , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg was proven right , however the oppos@@ ing party continues to con@@ test the matter to this day . 
<2en> you have to pay extremely careful attention . 
<2en> the matter is now pending before the Su@@ pre@@ me Court . 
<2en> W@@ entz@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the profession@@ alism of the courts . 
<2en> however , he also says : " the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . " 
<2en> the internal costs can bar@@ ely be calcu@@ lated , the company archi@@ ve even had to look through cent@@ ur@@ y@@ -@@ old records in order to provide proof . 
<2en> five years ago Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the oppos@@ ing party a " high six@@ -@@ figure sum in euros " as settlement . 
<2en> " this shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ entz@@ ler . 
<2en> the dangers in the F@@ ar East even threaten to sp@@ ill@@ ing over , back into Europe . 
<2en> particularly if imi@@ ta@@ tors secure un@@ protected br@@ and names there . 
<2en> for example , a Chinese manufac@@ turer wanted to register the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg label for sho@@ es and lea@@ ther in Germany . 
<2en> this is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration . 
<2en> " you have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ entz@@ ler . 
<2en> both he and Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch ad@@ vise companies to be very careful when conduc@@ ting business with China . 
<2en> it is not sufficient to rely on international tra@@ de@@ mark rights , rather for@@ eign@@ ers should also register " everything " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ entz@@ ler . 
<2en> otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fe@@ e . 
<2en> in actual fact : if Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg were to lo@@ ose at the final hur@@ dle of its tra@@ de@@ mark dra@@ ma , they would probably have to pay the oppos@@ ing party licen@@ se fe@@ es for the use of their own name , explained W@@ entz@@ ler . 
<2en> or alterna@@ tively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .

<2en> first of all , the sta@@ mping : Co@@ w@@ bo@@ y bo@@ ots , bas@@ ket@@ ball sho@@ es , ladies ' pu@@ mp@@ s and men 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the be@@ at on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that . 
<2en> on@@ e@@ -@@ two@@ -@@ thre@@ e@@ -@@ four . 
<2en> only then do the vo@@ ices of the sin@@ gers slowly s@@ well - alto , bas@@ s , ten@@ or and so@@ pr@@ ano sur@@ ge , be@@ gui@@ le and ha@@ un@@ t . 
<2en> and F@@ ie@@ te H@@ op@@ f , the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old conduc@@ tor , almost ris@@ es up out of his sho@@ es as he brings the ensemble together with his smoo@@ th , yet wi@@ ld gest@@ ures . 
<2en> it is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medi@@ cal P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology in Hei@@ del@@ berg the Im@@ bon@@ g@@ i C@@ ho@@ ir are prac@@ tising a new son@@ g . 
<2en> the fifteen sin@@ gers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tic@@ ists to the maintenance man . 
<2en> " O@@ m '@@ O@@ ban@@ i " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Z@@ ul@@ u , which is spoken by el@@ even million people in South Africa , Bo@@ ts@@ w@@ ana , Les@@ oth@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que and in parts of S@@ wa@@ z@@ iland . 
<2en> helping others to help themselves 
<2en> there are around 34 million people infec@@ ted with HIV around the world , as according to the estima@@ tions of U@@ NA@@ IDS , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS . 
<2en> of these , 2@@ 3.@@ 5 million live in South Africa . 
<2en> in S@@ wa@@ z@@ iland , there are 2@@ 4@@ 5@@ ,000 AIDS or@@ p@@ han@@ s . 
<2en> meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive . 
<2en> the Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found spon@@ sors in Germany for 1@@ 80 AIDS or@@ p@@ han@@ s in the village of E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i . 
<2en> 70 of these attend a secondary school . 
<2en> for 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a spon@@ sor . 
<2en> this guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm me@@ al each day in the Go@@ go Centre . 
<2en> in Z@@ ul@@ u , Im@@ bon@@ g@@ i means stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ ship@@ per . 
<2en> in this region , no@@ -@@ one can speak the Ban@@ tu language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it . 
<2en> for almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been prac@@ tising son@@ gs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa . 
<2en> for an 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilome@@ tre flight away from Hei@@ del@@ berg , in the north west of the S@@ wa@@ z@@ iland Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i , which re@@ lies on the vo@@ cal power of the German cho@@ ir . 
<2en> for@@ ty percent are infec@@ ted . 
<2en> around 2@@ ,000 people live there , some still in simple mu@@ d and stra@@ w hu@@ ts , and the majority of them are children . 
<2en> more than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they suc@@ cum@@ bed to the HIV virus . 
<2en> in E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i you get a small fores@@ ha@@ dow of the ill@@ ness from which all of S@@ wa@@ z@@ iland is suffering : according to Uni@@ ce@@ f , the region has the highest HIV infec@@ tion rates and the lowest life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the world . 
<2en> circum@@ c@@ ision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contrac@@ ting the virus by half , is bar@@ ely practi@@ sed by the population . 
<2en> more than for@@ ty percent of people in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ iland carry the immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus , and dying in you mid@@ -@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare . 
<2en> on a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the C@@ ho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the Im@@ bon@@ g@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in par@@ ental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clo@@ thing , education . 
<2en> without a school leaving certifica@@ te , there are bar@@ ely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country . 
<2en> initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm me@@ al a day for a few euros per year . 
<2en> however , just one year later , the cho@@ ir established the " Vo@@ ices for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS or@@ p@@ han@@ s in E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level . 
<2en> facts on sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions . 
<2en> what are the most important sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted diseases ? 
<2en> bac@@ terial ST@@ I@@ s include sy@@ p@@ hi@@ lis , ch@@ la@@ my@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea . 
<2en> common vi@@ ral ST@@ I@@ s are HIV , human pa@@ p@@ ill@@ om@@ a vir@@ uses , her@@ pes gen@@ itali@@ s and he@@ pati@@ tis . 
<2en> cra@@ bs and s@@ cab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ I@@ s . 
<2en> who are the main affected groups ? 
<2en> sy@@ p@@ hi@@ lis and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men . 
<2en> the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute under@@ stands that at least four in five of all sy@@ p@@ hi@@ lis cases reported in Germany are trans@@ mitted by means of sexual contact between men . 
<2en> among he@@ ter@@ o@@ sexual adul@@ ts , ch@@ la@@ my@@ dia infec@@ tions , tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ a@@ sis , can@@ di@@ di@@ a@@ sis ( fung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea and human pa@@ p@@ ill@@ om@@ a vir@@ uses are frequently oc@@ curr@@ ing sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted diseases . 
<2en> the spread of HIV among he@@ ter@@ o@@ sexual adul@@ ts in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV are found in this group . 
<2en> among young people , ch@@ la@@ my@@ dia infec@@ tions are much more common than in other population groups . 
<2en> according to European sur@@ ve@@ ys , three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 . 
<2en> in this country , human pa@@ p@@ ill@@ om@@ a vir@@ uses are also frequently found in young people . 
<2en> how has the number of infec@@ tions developed ? 
<2en> not all sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted diseases are noti@@ fiable . 
<2en> according to the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute , the number of sy@@ p@@ hi@@ lis infec@@ tions has more than dou@@ bled from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 . 
<2en> the number of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 . 
<2en> in 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases . 
<2en> this is around one ten@@ th fewer than the previous year . 
<2en> which symp@@ toms indicate a sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted disease ? 
<2en> the infec@@ tious diseases can cause ul@@ cers in the geni@@ tal area , dis@@ com@@ fort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and blis@@ ters or war@@ ts . 
<2en> however , often they cause no pain or any other symp@@ toms , thus remaining un@@ detec@@ ted . 
<2en> how can you protect yourself ? 
<2en> con@@ doms can reduce the risk of contra@@ ction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection . 
<2en> this is because occasion@@ ally , the pa@@ tho@@ gens of sexu@@ ally trans@@ mitted diseases can also be passed on via s@@ me@@ ar infec@@ tions and close bo@@ di@@ ly contact . 
<2en> therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners under@@ go regular examin@@ ations . 
<2en> if diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ I@@ s can be cu@@ red and long@@ -@@ term consequences avoided . 
<2en> through spon@@ sor@@ ships don@@ ations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all ad@@ ds up . 
<2en> " in total , we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i , " said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz , Cha@@ ir@@ person of the association . 
<2en> in the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ la@@ min@@ i , a sel@@ f@@ -@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , man@@ ages the money from Germany . 
<2en> she makes sure that the or@@ p@@ han@@ s have good accommo@@ dation , for example with one of their gran@@ d@@ mo@@ thers . 
<2en> the Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Z@@ ul@@ u , are the pillars of the village . 
<2en> some of them have up to 14 or@@ p@@ han@@ s living with them , providing them with a ro@@ of over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ ctu@@ ally every day , in their school uni@@ forms . 
<2en> anyone who do@@ es@@ n 't have anyone left , arri@@ ves at the sh@@ el@@ ter with K@@ han@@ y@@ isi@@ le , a single woman who ear@@ ns the same sal@@ ary from the association as the two co@@ o@@ ks who co@@ ok for more than 200 h@@ ung@@ ry children every day . 
<2en> in addition , " Vo@@ ices for Africa " has established a se@@ wing school , built two chi@@ cken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , P@@ S@@ I , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV . 
<2en> this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards ill@@ ness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under w@@ rap@@ s is if people are dead . 
<2en> a king with 14 wi@@ ves 
<2en> " AIDS is an absolute ta@@ bo@@ o subject , " said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz , " because it is associated with sexu@@ ality . " 
<2en> this is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wi@@ ves . 
<2en> the last absolute mon@@ arch of sub@@ -@@ Sah@@ aran Africa , K@@ ing M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his excessive li@@ fest@@ yle . 
<2en> pol@@ y@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy . 
<2en> among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attribu@@ ted to this officially san@@ ction@@ ed li@@ fest@@ yle . 
<2en> another factor is the large number of mi@@ grant workers who carry the virus across the country . 
<2en> there are free con@@ doms on every cor@@ ner , said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz , " but they are hardly used . 
<2en> the culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - f@@ les@@ h to f@@ les@@ h . " 
<2en> in order to promote the cultural exchange , the Im@@ bon@@ g@@ i cho@@ ir trav@@ els through Sou@@ thern Africa every two or three years and sin@@ gs son@@ gs of mel@@ an@@ ch@@ ol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black sel@@ f@@ -@@ este@@ em , which many from the southern ti@@ p of the black continent still know from the times of apar@@ thei@@ d . 
<2en> a bus full of white people , who sing son@@ gs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and jo@@ y , but some gri@@ m@@ -@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few te@@ ars . 
<2en> the journey always leads to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i , where the sin@@ gers visit their spon@@ sor children . 
<2en> even though you can bar@@ ely find the small village on a map , it is more than w@@ ell@@ -@@ known in the val@@ ley of the E@@ zu@@ l@@ wen@@ i Ri@@ ver . 
<2en> " go to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i , that 's where the light is , " say the people there . 
<2en> and if you make the 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilome@@ tre flight back to Hei@@ del@@ berg , to visit the st@@ om@@ ping sin@@ gers in their re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room , you 'll see that the light is there too . 
<2en> mes@@ sen@@ ger : NA@@ SA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cur@@ y 
<2en> the Mes@@ sen@@ ger pro@@ be has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cur@@ y . 
<2en> it is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 me@@ tres thi@@ ck . 
<2en> the US space agency , NA@@ SA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cur@@ y . 
<2en> although the planet lies clo@@ s@@ est to the su@@ n , it does have fro@@ zen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in speci@@ alist ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine " Sci@@ ence . " 
<2en> the Mes@@ sen@@ ger pro@@ be has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies perman@@ ently in shadow . 
<2en> this is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ time@@ tres and perhaps up to 20 me@@ tres thi@@ ck . 
<2en> the water pres@@ um@@ ably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that impac@@ ted with Mer@@ cur@@ y . 
<2en> however , no@@ -@@ one is lin@@ king the dis@@ co@@ very of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chi@@ ef Sci@@ enti@@ st for the Mes@@ sen@@ ger pro@@ be , Se@@ an Sol@@ om@@ on . 
<2en> the temperat@@ ure on Mer@@ cur@@ y can reach up to 4@@ 26 degre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us . 
<2en> that said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blo@@ cks of life reached other regions of the solar system . 
<2en> un@@ known to the majority of the Ear@@ th 's inhabitants , there are pro@@ bes , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and small ro@@ bots such as the P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , deplo@@ yed to research the dep@@ ths of the uni@@ verse . 
<2en> from time to time , they trans@@ mit images to Ear@@ th : small pe@@ ep@@ hol@@ es into the infin@@ ite expan@@ se . 
<2en> this image comes from a ca@@ mera developed by German researchers at the Ma@@ x Plan@@ ck Institute . 
<2en> the eight plan@@ ets of our solar system , plus the d@@ war@@ f planet C@@ eres . 
<2en> like P@@ lu@@ to , which or@@ b@@ its around the su@@ n behind Nep@@ t@@ une , C@@ eres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International A@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ ical Union in 2006 . 
<2en> this image section from an infr@@ ared rec@@ ord@@ ing by the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope shows a " family por@@ trait " of coun@@ tless generations of st@@ ars : the ol@@ dest st@@ ars are seen as blue do@@ ts , while more difficult to identify are the pin@@ k@@ -@@ col@@ ou@@ red " new@@ -@@ bor@@ ns " in the star delivery room . 
<2en> this star@@ -@@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope in the Cas@@ si@@ o@@ pe@@ ia con@@ st@@ el@@ lation , at a distance of 6@@ ,@@ 500 light years away . 
<2en> this sh@@ immer@@ ing g@@ low of a dying star was cap@@ tured by NA@@ SA 's Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope . 
<2en> the don@@ ut@@ -@@ sha@@ ped ring consists of material , e@@ jec@@ ted by the star in the process of dying . 
<2en> in the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d Ne@@ bu@@ la , 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Ear@@ th , new st@@ ars are created from gas and dus@@ t . 
<2en> NA@@ SA 's Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope sho@@ t this p@@ hoto of the gal@@ ac@@ tic delivery room . 
<2en> the P@@ lei@@ a@@ des star cl@@ us@@ ter , also referred to as " The S@@ even S@@ is@@ ters , " can be seen with the bare eye at night . 
<2en> with the tel@@ es@@ cope , however , the col@@ ours really come into their own . 
<2en> in this infr@@ ared p@@ hoto , the H@@ eli@@ x Ne@@ bu@@ la looks back at the observer like a red eye . 
<2en> it is located 700 light years away in the A@@ qu@@ ari@@ us con@@ st@@ el@@ lation . 
<2en> its simi@@ lar@@ ity with the continent resulted in this Ne@@ bu@@ la acqu@@ iring the title ' North America ' . 
<2en> a combination of normal and infr@@ ared photo@@ graphy produced the specta@@ cular col@@ ouring . 
<2en> this bab@@ y star could only be cap@@ tured in its full beau@@ ty using the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope 's infr@@ ared detec@@ tors . 
<2en> Sat@@ ur@@ n and its r@@ ings : how these occurred is the greatest pu@@ z@@ z@@ le in the field of as@@ tron@@ om@@ y . 
<2en> perhaps they are the rem@@ n@@ ants of a mo@@ on of Sat@@ ur@@ n , which dis@@ appeared without a tra@@ ce 4.@@ 5 billion years ago . 
<2en> one of the largest and shar@@ pest pic@@ tures from the Hu@@ b@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope : the Wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool G@@ al@@ ax@@ y 
<2en> depending on the col@@ ouring , photo@@ grap@@ hs of spi@@ ral gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es can become genuine works of art . 
<2en> the photo@@ graph published by the European Sou@@ thern Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d Ne@@ bu@@ la in the S@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us con@@ st@@ el@@ lation , several thousand light years away . 
<2en> the name Tri@@ fi@@ d ste@@ ms from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus ( divided into three parts ) , as dar@@ k stri@@ pes of dus@@ t divide the core of the bir@@ th@@ place of st@@ ars into three parts . 
<2en> in the Op@@ hi@@ uch@@ us con@@ st@@ el@@ lation , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers have photo@@ grap@@ hed the signs of a cos@@ mic col@@ l@@ ision : 400 million light years from the earth , the cor@@ es of two mer@@ ging gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es move rapidly towards one another , dest@@ ined to col@@ li@@ de . 
<2en> this star birth was cap@@ tured by the Hu@@ b@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope in the M@@ 83 spi@@ ral gal@@ ax@@ y . 
<2en> anyone who do@@ es@@ n 't like technical ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its ni@@ ck@@ name , the Sou@@ thern Ca@@ ther@@ ine W@@ he@@ el . 
<2en> the p@@ hoto taken by the Hu@@ b@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope shows a section of the Ir@@ is Ne@@ bu@@ la in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us con@@ st@@ el@@ lation . 
<2en> the ne@@ bu@@ la , 1,@@ 400 light years away , consists of par@@ ticles of dus@@ t that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dus@@ t . 
<2en> this image was put together from the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y images cap@@ tured by various tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es . 
<2en> it shows a ring of black hol@@ es , 4@@ 30 million light years away from the Ear@@ th . 
<2en> this group of gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es , named Ar@@ p 2@@ 73 , was pic@@ tured for NA@@ SA by the Hu@@ b@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
<2en> scientists call the larger spi@@ ral gal@@ ax@@ y U@@ G@@ C 18@@ 10 . 
<2en> this star ne@@ bu@@ la is home to the bri@@ gh@@ test group of young st@@ ars in our Mil@@ ky Wa@@ y . 
<2en> this ' star cra@@ dle ' continu@@ ally produ@@ ces new yo@@ ung@@ sters . 
<2en> likewise , this star cl@@ ou@@ d , connected to the Ro@@ se@@ tte Ne@@ bu@@ la , continu@@ ally produ@@ ces new bab@@ y st@@ ars - 5@@ 000 light years away from the Ear@@ th . 
<2en> in this b@@ right sh@@ ining gal@@ ax@@ y with one small black hole , there exists no dus@@ t - only gas . 
<2en> researchers presu@@ me that it only came into being shortly after the Bi@@ g Ban@@ g , when the uni@@ verse was com@@ pris@@ ed primarily of hydro@@ gen . 
<2en> our view of the uni@@ verse : the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es 
<2en> the tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have been inven@@ ted in 16@@ 08 by Hans Li@@ p@@ per@@ he@@ y - even before Galileo Gali@@ le@@ i used the device to observe the st@@ ars one year later . 
<2en> since then , the mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors in op@@ tical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the in@@ si@@ ghts that they provide increasingly profound . 
<2en> for a period of 30 years , namely from 19@@ 47 until 19@@ 75 , the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory near San D@@ ie@@ go was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world . 
<2en> the mi@@ r@@ ror , shown in the image , had a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of five me@@ tres . 
<2en> Ari@@ zona , USA , is home to the L@@ ar@@ ge B@@ in@@ ocu@@ lar Tel@@ es@@ cope . 
<2en> it enables views of space via two mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors , each with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 8.@@ 4 me@@ tres . 
<2en> the in@@ ner work@@ ings of the Gran Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Can@@ arias on the Can@@ arian island of La Pal@@ ma are huge - the mi@@ r@@ ror alone has a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 10@@ .@@ 4 me@@ tres . 
<2en> the mi@@ r@@ ror of the Sou@@ thern African L@@ ar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs . 
<2en> in spite of this it achiev@@ es a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of around el@@ even me@@ tres . 
<2en> the disadvantage of this in@@ expensive construction method : the tel@@ es@@ cope is secu@@ rely cla@@ m@@ ped at its angle of incl@@ in@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited . 
<2en> the H@@ ob@@ by E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Tex@@ as also has a fixed angle of incl@@ in@@ ation . 
<2en> what sets it apart : the high li@@ ght@@ -@@ gather@@ ing capacity . 
<2en> this - in spite of its compara@@ tively low mi@@ r@@ ror di@@ a@@ me@@ ter - even mat@@ ches that of the world 's largest reflec@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es . 
<2en> with the help of a radio tel@@ es@@ cope in A@@ reci@@ bo ( P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ co ) researchers can listen for extra@@ ter@@ restri@@ al signals in space . 
<2en> the radio tel@@ es@@ cope has a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 30@@ 5 me@@ tres . 
<2en> in the " Se@@ arch for Ex@@ tra@@ ter@@ restri@@ al In@@ tel@@ li@@ gence " ( SE@@ T@@ I ) every computer ow@@ ner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available . 
<2en> view of the European Sou@@ thern Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chi@@ le@@ an An@@ des . 
<2en> this is home to the Ver@@ y L@@ ar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope , which lives up to its name . 
<2en> with its total of four mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors , the tel@@ es@@ cope can also focus on the medi@@ al infr@@ ared spectrum . 
<2en> likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory in Chile , the European Extre@@ mely L@@ ar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being planned . 
<2en> its main mi@@ r@@ ror is to sp@@ an a full 42 me@@ tres and will be made from almost 1@@ ,000 mi@@ r@@ ror elements . 
<2en> however , images are not to be expected until 201@@ 8 at the ear@@ liest . 
<2en> until 2007 , the two K@@ ec@@ k tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian vol@@ can@@ o , Ma@@ una K@@ ea , were the largest in the world . 
<2en> they each have two mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors , each with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of ten me@@ ters . 
<2en> the K@@ ec@@ k Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una K@@ ea Ob@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory , which alongside the K@@ ec@@ k tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , can look to the he@@ a@@ ven@@ s with the help of the Su@@ bar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the IR@@ T@@ T@@ F . 
<2en> another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una K@@ ea , with a mi@@ r@@ ror di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of thir@@ ty me@@ tres . 
<2en> here you can mar@@ vel at an arti@@ st 's impression . 
<2en> however , the most important in@@ si@@ ghts into space are provided by the Hu@@ b@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
<2en> since 24 April 1990 it has been sup@@ pl@@ ying images of dis@@ tant wor@@ l@@ ds . 
<2en> since March 2009 the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope has been se@@ arch@@ ing for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be in@@ habi@@ table . 
<2en> on 2 February 2011 it was announced by NA@@ SA that 1,@@ 2@@ 35 plan@@ etary candidates had been identified since the mission began . 
<2en> the image documents the final launch preparations on the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
<2en> the J@@ ames Web@@ b S@@ pace Tel@@ es@@ cope ( J@@ W@@ S@@ T ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ an@@ e@@ 5 ro@@ cket by 201@@ 8 at the ear@@ liest . 
<2en> the primary mi@@ r@@ ror of the infr@@ ared space tel@@ es@@ cope has a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 6.@@ 5 me@@ tres . 
<2en> one of the tel@@ es@@ cope 's tasks is to search for light from the first st@@ ars and gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es that emerged after the Bi@@ g Ban@@ g . 
<2en> scientists are assu@@ ming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cur@@ y 's south po@@ le . 
<2en> however , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Mes@@ sen@@ ger or@@ b@@ its around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north po@@ le . 
<2en> for decades , ra@@ dar measu@@ rements have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cur@@ y . 
<2en> thanks to the Mes@@ sen@@ ger pro@@ be that was launched in 2004 , the first to or@@ bit Mer@@ cur@@ y , scientists can now be certain .

<2en> there is even a mu@@ se@@ um of lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity . 
<2en> a hun@@ t for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compara@@ tively young .

<2en> yet pi@@ la@@ ta Fa@@ tu@@ la@@ y@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attra@@ ction . 
<2en> " Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test , and next year we are having a fes@@ tiv@@ al to celeb@@ rate the ol@@ dest people in the world , " said Fa@@ tu@@ la@@ y@@ eva . 
<2en> she is the Director of the M@@ use@@ um of Lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , most likely the only of its kind in the world . 
<2en> here the lives of eight do@@ zen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are docu@@ mented . Fa@@ tu@@ la@@ y@@ eva points out a black & white p@@ hoto . 
<2en> this here is my gran@@ d@@ father , he was 120 years old . 
<2en> at the age of 13@@ 6 he fa@@ ther@@ ed another child . 
<2en> however , the un@@ ri@@ val@@ led star of the mu@@ se@@ um is she@@ pher@@ d Sh@@ ir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 16@@ 8 years old . 
<2en> however no birth certifica@@ te exists to confirm this . 
<2en> and given that the lon@@ gest confirmed lif@@ esp@@ an was 12@@ 2 years of age , Musli@@ mo@@ v 's claim seems extremely doub@@ t@@ ful . 
<2en> " he was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 197@@ 3 , " expla@@ ins Fa@@ tu@@ la@@ y@@ eva . 
<2en> the man mar@@ ried three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ ther@@ ed another dau@@ ghter at the age of 13@@ 6 . 
<2en> so did Sh@@ ir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calcu@@ late his age by a couple of decades ? 
<2en> but R@@ emb@@ ran@@ dt Sch@@ ol@@ z , resear@@ cher on ageing at the Ma@@ x Plan@@ ck Institute in Ro@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impres@@ sive ages in Central Asia . 
<2en> " a stri@@ k@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the H@@ un@@ za V@@ alle@@ y in Pakistan , " said Sch@@ ol@@ z , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sar@@ d@@ ini@@ a . " 
<2en> due to lacking docu@@ mentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth regis@@ ters . 
<2en> mel@@ ted bu@@ tter by the gla@@ ss , every day 
<2en> however , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bibli@@ cal age with stri@@ king regular@@ ity . 
<2en> there are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age . 
<2en> so why do so many very old people live here in the south ? 
<2en> the Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ ari@@ d Mu@@ gim@@ z@@ ade@@ h expla@@ ins this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh gene@@ tics . 
<2en> in contrast , M@@ use@@ um Director Fa@@ tu@@ la@@ y@@ eva believes that it is due to di@@ et . 
<2en> however the notion that the cal@@ ori@@ e@@ -@@ rich di@@ et of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bre@@ ad and especially dairy products , and of whom many drin@@ k a gla@@ ss of mel@@ ted bu@@ tter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutri@@ tion science perspective does not really seem pl@@ au@@ sible either . 
<2en> or is it the traditional way of life that keep@@ s the people young ? in C@@ en@@ gem@@ i@@ ran , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Ru@@ bab@@ a M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva . 
<2en> at 97 years old she is still compara@@ tively young for the area . 
<2en> M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 14@@ 3 descen@@ dants , lives in a simple wo@@ o@@ den house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region . 
<2en> she si@@ ts on the floor with a bu@@ tter ch@@ ur@@ n , which she ro@@ lls back@@ wards and for@@ wards ti@@ re@@ less@@ ly . 
<2en> eight people live here under this ro@@ of , including one of M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's sons and a dau@@ ghter , both of whom have been gran@@ d@@ parents for some time . 
<2en> there are also two small children running around . 
<2en> in the k@@ it@@ chen , te@@ a is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Ar@@ ma@@ du gla@@ sses . 
<2en> M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's white te@@ e@@ th stand in perfect ran@@ k and file , bene@@ ath her head@@ scar@@ f she conce@@ als long , dar@@ k bl@@ on@@ d pla@@ its , which her son prou@@ dly reve@@ als for us . 
<2en> I have always was@@ hed my ha@@ ir with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its col@@ our . 
<2en> " I have never used sha@@ m@@ po@@ o either , " said M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva . 
<2en> mon@@ thly pension is enough to live on 
<2en> she has only ever e@@ aten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ a@@ to@@ es , po@@ ta@@ to@@ es , pe@@ as . 
<2en> my whole life I have never once b@@ ought gro@@ cer@@ ies in the super@@ market . 
<2en> then she t@@ ells of her hus@@ band who was in the army . 
<2en> things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War . 
<2en> however , everything became better when the " bel@@ ov@@ ed father " He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ ye@@ v took the ru@@ d@@ der . 
<2en> the propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old la@@ dy . 
<2en> yet the cul@@ t that re@@ vol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dicta@@ tor practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan . 
<2en> he held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the hel@@ m . 
<2en> at least there is no de@@ priv@@ ation among Azerbaijan 's elderly . 
<2en> M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva recei@@ ves 2@@ 30 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfor@@ tably . 
<2en> and perhaps M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's long gre@@ ying son is right : " the elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . " 
<2en> they live among their extended family , are lo@@ ved , car@@ ed for and are happy . 
<2en> if this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ? 
<2en> the notion of " human rights " is om@@ it@@ ted from the constitution . 
<2en> the revolution has returned to C@@ air@@ o . 
<2en> compe@@ ting demonstra@@ tions in C@@ air@@ o reve@@ al the deep division within the country . 
<2en> the future constitution based on Sh@@ aria law is fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely dispu@@ ted . 
<2en> the E@@ gyp@@ tian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion . 
<2en> we must make the transition . 
<2en> " and making sure it succe@@ eds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , " he said on state television . 
<2en> his speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the C@@ op@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , en@@ li@@ ghtened Musli@@ ms and secu@@ lar@@ ists . 
<2en> for all of them , until now hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly es@@ tran@@ ged in a be@@ wi@@ l@@ dered opposition , are fe@@ ar@@ ful . 
<2en> they are fe@@ ar@@ ful of a God State on the N@@ ile at the mer@@ cy of the powerful Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood . 
<2en> according to Mo@@ ha@@ med M@@ ur@@ si , speaking almost apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ tically , he has tempor@@ arily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , " in order to res@@ cue the revolution . " 
<2en> however , E@@ gyp@@ ti@@ ans - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old engine@@ er who holds a D@@ oc@@ torate from the American University of Sou@@ thern C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , really wants to save . 
<2en> should the judici@@ ary be depri@@ ved of power ? 
<2en> in actual fact , the 2@@ 34 articles , which have been pus@@ hed through by the Isla@@ mi@@ c@@ -@@ domin@@ ated 1@@ 10@@ -@@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern . 
<2en> as was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft judi@@ ca@@ ture is justified on the " principles of Islamic law . " 
<2en> yet what are " principles " ? 
<2en> this was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Isla@@ mis@@ ts will make use of the wo@@ ol@@ ly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sh@@ aria law . 
<2en> this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sh@@ aria law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sun@@ ni Islam . 
<2en> this can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the cl@@ er@@ gy will over@@ see legislation , which would result in the de facto in@@ capaci@@ tation of the judici@@ ary . 
<2en> much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation 
<2en> also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be up@@ held . 
<2en> during Mu@@ bar@@ ak 's rule , these courts served to sup@@ press opposition . 
<2en> following the fall of the dicta@@ tor , up to 1@@ 1@@ ,000 civilians were under military imprison@@ ment . 
<2en> according to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the E@@ gyp@@ tian family , and promote its mor@@ als and values . " 
<2en> from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an un@@ clear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cin@@ em@@ atic art and liter@@ at@@ ure . 
<2en> in pla@@ in language , this is nothing other than cens@@ or@@ ship . 
<2en> incidentally , no article explicitly establis@@ hes the equality of men and women . 
<2en> another does prohi@@ bit the insu@@ lt or s@@ lander of the pro@@ ph@@ et Mo@@ ha@@ med and his em@@ iss@@ aries . 
<2en> however , what constitutes an insu@@ lt and how this should be san@@ ction@@ ed remains un@@ clear . 
<2en> equally du@@ bi@@ ous is the formulation stating that " insul@@ ting people " is for@@ bi@@ dden . 
<2en> is a c@@ ari@@ ca@@ ture of the president sufficient , or a jo@@ ke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ? 
<2en> open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by M@@ ur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to E@@ gyp@@ ti@@ ans for referendum " very soon . " 
<2en> " the revolution is back " 
<2en> for weeks the opposition has been gather@@ ing to combat the superior strength of the Isla@@ mis@@ ts . 
<2en> tens of thousands gather@@ ed on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ rir S@@ qu@@ are in C@@ air@@ o , in un@@ familiar unity , and ple@@ dged to bring down the char@@ ter before it has even come into effect . 
<2en> " the revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ tori@@ ous , " said Ham@@ din S@@ ab@@ ba@@ hi , third place candidate in the presidential elections . 
<2en> no@@ ble Pe@@ ace Prize win@@ ner and former He@@ ad of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Authority , Mo@@ ha@@ med El@@ -@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belongs " on the ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish ti@@ p of history . " 
<2en> via S@@ MS service T@@ wit@@ ter , he accused M@@ ur@@ si 's fol@@ lo@@ wers of wan@@ ting to lead " a coup against democracy . " 
<2en> " if he calls for the referendum , we will go to his pal@@ ace and over@@ throw him , " said member of the opposition J@@ asser S@@ aid . 
<2en> " we have not yet grown ti@@ red , the blood of our bro@@ thers has not yet been at@@ on@@ ed for , " stated the E@@ gyp@@ tian media , quo@@ ting opposition politici@@ an C@@ hal@@ ed Al@@ i . 
<2en> and several judges have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum , which would ren@@ der it inv@@ ali@@ d . 
<2en> " the Kor@@ an is our constitution " 
<2en> the w@@ ell@@ -@@ organised Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood gather@@ ed for a counter@@ -@@ demonstration , although acting cau@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ rir S@@ qu@@ are but rather a mass pra@@ yer on the other side of the N@@ ile , outside the C@@ air@@ o University . 
<2en> many vei@@ led women and fol@@ lo@@ wers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , sh@@ ou@@ ting out : " the people demand the application of God 's law . " 
<2en> they demanded of M@@ ur@@ si : " clean@@ se the country ! " and pro@@ tested : " the Kor@@ an is our constitution . " 
<2en> a struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ ah@@ rir S@@ qu@@ are , where everything began , would have most likely provo@@ ked events ver@@ ging on civil war . 
<2en> quite clearly , this was something that M@@ ur@@ si 's fol@@ lo@@ wers did not want to risk . 
<2en> the Muslim Bro@@ thers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear . 
<2en> now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot box , in which direction the country should move forward . 
<2en> it is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Isla@@ mis@@ ts ' draft . 
<2en> " the term ' human rights ' does not even appear once " 
<2en> Haf@@ ez Ab@@ u Sa@@ eda is fur@@ i@@ ous about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have las@@ ted until February and should have involved all social interest groups . 
<2en> the 4@@ 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old human rights law@@ yer and Chairman of the E@@ gyp@@ tian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ H@@ R ) defen@@ ded the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , when imprison@@ ed or in court under Mu@@ bar@@ ak . 
<2en> not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indi@@ visible . 
<2en> for this he was bat@@ tered , condemned and imprison@@ ed . 
<2en> " and now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with " Welt am Sonn@@ tag . " 
<2en> the law@@ yer has resi@@ g@@ ned himself to M@@ ur@@ si extending his power to all three bran@@ ches of state government . 
<2en> these measures are bla@@ tant bre@@ aches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship . 
<2en> " instead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspen@@ ding it , " compla@@ ined Sa@@ eda . 
<2en> yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function . 
<2en> Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is obser@@ ving the battle over the ideological direction on the N@@ ile with a mix@@ ture of curi@@ o@@ sity and exci@@ tement . 
<2en> this could come back to ha@@ un@@ t them . 
<2en> one demonstra@@ tor at the T@@ ah@@ rir war@@ ned : " you are le@@ tting lo@@ ose a mon@@ ster that you can no longer control . " 
<2en> Nor@@ way 's ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k : is this the world 's sm@@ el@@ liest fish ? 
<2en> Nor@@ way 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world . 
<2en> could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local ap@@ petite for some exce@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ elly fish ? 
<2en> take a selection of over@@ -@@ ri@@ pe che@@ eses . 
<2en> place them in the mid@@ st of a pi@@ le of dir@@ ty , w@@ et so@@ c@@ cer k@@ it . 
<2en> leave for a week . 
<2en> now you have the no@@ se@@ -@@ num@@ bing sm@@ ell of ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an deli@@ ca@@ cies . 
<2en> I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , about three hours from Oslo . 
<2en> there is s@@ now , specta@@ cular scen@@ ery - and that od@@ our , ever present , han@@ gs in the air . 
<2en> ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut spr@@ ink@@ led with sal@@ t and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year . 
<2en> as the dar@@ k sets in and the wea@@ ther turns cold , Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a fes@@ tiv@@ al here in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods . 
<2en> " you eat it raw , and then s@@ wal@@ low a gla@@ ss of aqu@@ av@@ it , " says H@@ av@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time local fi@@ refi@@ ghter but also the so@@ -@@ called " R@@ ak@@ fis@@ k General , " in charge of running the fes@@ tiv@@ al . 
<2en> all around us people are e@@ ating little cu@@ bes of the fish and kno@@ cking back quantities of drin@@ k . 
<2en> " some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k , " says H@@ av@@ ard . 
<2en> the drin@@ k can kil@@ l the sm@@ ell . 
<2en> I try a few pie@@ ces . 
<2en> if you can avoid passing it under your no@@ se , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey . 
<2en> ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stri@@ cken times in Nor@@ way when , pre@@ -@@ re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , fish was so@@ ak@@ ed in air@@ ti@@ ght bar@@ re@@ ls of water and sal@@ t in autumn . 
<2en> then in the dep@@ ths of win@@ ter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the sen@@ ses kno@@ cked out by alcohol - e@@ aten . 
<2en> only a generation ago , thousands of Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , emi@@ gra@@ ting mainly to the US . 
<2en> now the population is expan@@ ding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attra@@ cted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system . 
<2en> people from Sweden , the old ri@@ val and not so long ago far ri@@ cher than Nor@@ way , stream in to work . 
<2en> ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ elly part of Nor@@ way 's past . 
<2en> it is among the more expensive dis@@ hes you can buy . 
<2en> but then everything is expensive - a small gla@@ ss of be@@ er or a san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch kno@@ ck you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each . 
<2en> Nor@@ way does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way . 
<2en> people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name An@@ ders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the ri@@ ght@@ -@@ wing , rac@@ ist extremis@@ t who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year . 
<2en> instead , the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as " the July the 2@@ 2@@ nd incident . " 
<2en> Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peace@@ -@@ lo@@ ving country one of their own was capable of such bru@@ tali@@ ty and murder . 
<2en> the growth since the early 197@@ 0s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Nor@@ way 's present@@ -@@ day wealth . 
<2en> " but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says An@@ na our wa@@ it@@ res@@ s , han@@ ding round tra@@ ys of ma@@ turing ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ on@@ d ha@@ ir and star@@ tl@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic w@@ ell@@ -@@ being . 
<2en> we are a - how you say - pru@@ dent people . 
<2en> her English , like that of most people here , is fla@@ w@@ less . 
<2en> we are not very sho@@ w@@ y , we do not like o@@ sten@@ tation . 
<2en> Nor@@ way has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations . 
<2en> when everyone else was thro@@ wing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial cra@@ sh , Nor@@ way kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings ti@@ ghtly bound . 
<2en> " as long as we can ski in win@@ ter and go hi@@ king in summer we are happy , " says An@@ na . 
<2en> " and eat ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k , " she ad@@ ds with a car@@ ef@@ re@@ e lau@@ gh . 
<2en> I stand in the s@@ now and que@@ ue for something to eat - I have had enough ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k . 
<2en> now an el@@ k bur@@ ger is certainly something different and rather suc@@ cul@@ ent to the ta@@ ste . 
<2en> but in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ elly fish . 
<2en> the hotel I am sta@@ ying in is one of a number of ven@@ ues ho@@ sting a ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k din@@ ner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most n@@ as@@ ally chall@@ eng@@ ing - fish . 
<2en> there is a live TV link up to a com@@ pere in a bo@@ w tie surro@@ unded by pla@@ tes of ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k . 
<2en> it is like the Euro@@ vision son@@ g con@@ test . 
<2en> " what s@@ core do you have for the best fish up there in the moun@@ tains Th@@ or@@ -@@ J@@ uer@@ gen ? " 
<2en> " here are our points , H@@ av@@ ard . " 
<2en> there is cla@@ pping , lau@@ ghter . 
<2en> a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it . 
<2en> or maybe it is the fu@@ mes from all that fish . 
<2en> Mexico 's En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to faces tough start 
<2en> as Mexico 's in@@ coming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to prepar@@ es to take office , the B@@ BC 's Wil@@ l Gr@@ ant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population . 
<2en> traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present . 
<2en> a con@@ ges@@ ted city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been er@@ ec@@ ted since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads . 
<2en> the aim , however , was@@ n 't to stop com@@ mu@@ ters getting to work but prevent pro@@ tes@@ ters from reaching parliament . 
<2en> on Sat@@ ur@@ day , Mexico 's new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ as@@ h and take over the running of the nation . 
<2en> he faces a complicated task . 
<2en> Mexico has been per@@ forming well economically under the out@@ going administration of F@@ eli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the gri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60@@ ,000 lives in six years . 
<2en> " my government has a great commitment to the Mexi@@ can people to reduce the violence , " Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to told US President Bar@@ ack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week . 
<2en> I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim . 
<2en> before ru@@ b@@ bing shoul@@ ders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to 's previous political experience was as govern@@ or of his home state , the State of Mexico . 
<2en> a popu@@ l@@ ous , spra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ om@@ ping ground . 
<2en> a stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward man 
<2en> in the bu@@ co@@ lic town of V@@ alle del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remember@@ ed fon@@ dly . 
<2en> residents credit him with boo@@ sting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure . 
<2en> to reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cra@@ cked and bu@@ mp@@ y roads it replaced . 
<2en> pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impres@@ sive inter@@ active mu@@ se@@ um about climate change . 
<2en> " we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally G@@ abri@@ el Ol@@ vera Her@@ nan@@ dez , a state con@@ gres@@ s@@ man for Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to 's party , the P@@ R@@ I . 
<2en> particularly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs . 
<2en> after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the P@@ R@@ I was ous@@ ted in 2000 by Vi@@ c@@ ente Fo@@ x . 
<2en> Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ vera ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of Los P@@ inos , there is much expec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to . 
<2en> and he re@@ jects the opposition 's character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance . 
<2en> he 's a very stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country . 
<2en> he 's an excellent stat@@ es@@ man and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen . 
<2en> but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former govern@@ or . 
<2en> in Ne@@ zah@@ u@@ alco@@ yo@@ t@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ b@@ bled streets of V@@ alle del Bra@@ vo cou@@ ld@@ n 't be shar@@ per . 
<2en> tu@@ cked away under motor@@ way fl@@ yo@@ vers , it is in many ways a sub@@ ur@@ b of Mexico City itself . 
<2en> and the problems in the munici@@ pa@@ lity are also gr@@ it@@ ty and urban . 
<2en> earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbour@@ ho@@ ods , and violence against women is particularly ac@@ ute . 
<2en> on a pa@@ tch of wa@@ st@@ eland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of doz@@ ens of mur@@ dered women have been dum@@ ped over the past two years alone . 
<2en> more than 1@@ ,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to was govern@@ or , a rate much higher than in the no@@ tori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with the murder of innocent women . 
<2en> Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to 's cri@@ tics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ i@@ cide while he was in office . 
<2en> at worst , they accus@@ e his administration of turning a blind eye . 
<2en> in a concrete home typical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Bu@@ en@@ dia strug@@ g@@ les to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me pho@@ tos of her late dau@@ ghter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una . 
<2en> according to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed sui@@ cide in 2010 . 
<2en> however her family believes she was mur@@ dered by her partner . 
<2en> " when I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been was@@ hed , " Sen@@ ora Bu@@ en@@ dia rec@@ alls . 
<2en> there were signs she '@@ d been be@@ aten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in . 
<2en> as her mother re@@ coun@@ ts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the w@@ alls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice . 
<2en> however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied . 
<2en> the state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old go@@ ssi@@ p , a trou@@ ble@@ -@@ ma@@ ker , a wh@@ iner . 
<2en> what they want is that one simply accepts what they say and sh@@ u@@ ts up . 
<2en> " but that can 't be right when there were so many irregularities and omis@@ sions , " she says . 
<2en> as President P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to recei@@ ves the s@@ as@@ h on Sat@@ ur@@ day , it comes with a heavy responsibility . 
<2en> tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office . 
<2en> " I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a govern@@ or , " says P@@ R@@ I Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ vera in V@@ alle del Bra@@ vo . 
<2en> that , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za most fear .

<2en> the hearing focuses on Man@@ ning 's time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a 
<2en> defen@@ se wants case dis@@ missed on grounds that Man@@ ning 's confin@@ ement was har@@ sh 
<2en> the Ar@@ my private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classi@@ fied documents 
<2en> prosecu@@ tors tried to establish Friday that Ar@@ my private Bra@@ d@@ ley Man@@ ning -- charged in the largest lea@@ k of classi@@ fied material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to compla@@ in about the mis@@ treatment he 's al@@ leg@@ ing he suffered in military cus@@ to@@ dy . 
<2en> while cross@@ -@@ examining Man@@ ning at a pre@@ -@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosecu@@ tor Ma@@ j@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asser@@ ted that records of week@@ ly vis@@ its Man@@ ning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , show no complaints about his treatment . 
<2en> the cross@@ -@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defen@@ se motion to have Man@@ ning 's case dis@@ missed on grounds that his confin@@ ement has been har@@ sh and has amoun@@ ted to enough punishment -- came a day after Man@@ ning testi@@ fied that he had considered sui@@ cide while in cus@@ to@@ dy . 
<2en> the Ar@@ my intelligence analy@@ st , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classi@@ fied documents while ser@@ ving in Iraq . 
<2en> the material was then published online by Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s . 
<2en> Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s has never confirmed that Man@@ ning was the source of its information . 
<2en> in Friday 's hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Man@@ ning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Man@@ ning during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a hei@@ ghtened confin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 . 
<2en> officers would ask Man@@ ning questions and write down his responses . 
<2en> when F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Man@@ ning acknowledged that he ra@@ ted treatment by his guar@@ ds as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . " 
<2en> the forms show no complaints of mis@@ treatment , even though the officers asked Man@@ ning directly about his treatment , F@@ ein conten@@ ded . 
<2en> Man@@ ning responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the vis@@ iting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they di@@ dn 't record the issues . 
<2en> " they would write down ' no issues ' ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it di@@ dn 't necessarily mean I di@@ dn 't bring something up , " Man@@ ning said . 
<2en> the judge , Ar@@ my Col@@ . Den@@ ise Lin@@ d , also asked Man@@ ning why he di@@ dn 't compla@@ in about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the sui@@ ci@@ dal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier . 
<2en> Man@@ ning repli@@ ed that his intention during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injur@@ y " status down@@ gra@@ ded . 
<2en> the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below sui@@ cide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others . 
<2en> " I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my vie@@ w@@ point , " Man@@ ning said . 
<2en> Man@@ ning testi@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Mar@@ ine B@@ ase Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a in July 2010 . 
<2en> he said he contempla@@ ted sui@@ cide in Ku@@ wait and once passed out there due to the he@@ at . 
<2en> he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dis@@ tr@@ essing . 
<2en> " my world just s@@ hr@@ in@@ k to Cam@@ p Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that ca@@ ge , " Man@@ ning said Thursday . 
<2en> I thought I was going to die in that ca@@ ge . 
<2en> once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Man@@ ning said , he spend most days in a small cel@@ l -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company . 
<2en> Man@@ ning said he was allowed only a mat@@ tress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops , some clo@@ th@@ es and his gla@@ sses . 
<2en> he said he tried to keep moving , because sle@@ ep@@ ing during the day or even lying down was against the rules . 
<2en> Man@@ ning said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cel@@ l in his eyes . 
<2en> if guar@@ ds could not see his face when he ro@@ lled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over . 
<2en> Man@@ ning 's law@@ yer fi@@ led a formal objection to Man@@ ning 's treatment in January 2011 . 
<2en> Man@@ ning was moved to the military prison at For@@ t Lea@@ ven@@ worth , K@@ ans@@ as , in April 2011 . 
<2en> also Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ning about an al@@ leg@@ ation that he made in Thursday 's testi@@ mon@@ y -- that after being forced to sle@@ ep na@@ ked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cel@@ l , he was forced to stand na@@ ked in front of guar@@ ds and other in@@ ma@@ tes during a morning head count . 
<2en> Man@@ ning had testi@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count . 
<2en> under question@@ ing from the judge Friday , Man@@ ning said that he infer@@ red from his guard 's order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had or@@ dered him to drop it . 
<2en> Man@@ ning testi@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sle@@ ep na@@ ked the previous night because of his attempt to show an offi@@ cer that he was@@ n 't a danger to himself . 
<2en> Man@@ ning said that he told the offi@@ cer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ we@@ ar or his fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops to hur@@ t himself but ha@@ dn 't done so . 
<2en> that night , Man@@ ning testi@@ fied , his under@@ we@@ ar , fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops and gla@@ sses were removed from his cel@@ l . 
<2en> his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confin@@ ement into account and shar@@ ply reduce his sentence should he be convi@@ cted at his cour@@ t@@ -@@ mar@@ tial , which is expected to begin early next year . 
<2en> the defen@@ se has said it plans to have Man@@ ning ple@@ ad guilty to les@@ ser offen@@ ses and fight other charges as being too extreme . 
<2en> the hearing is scheduled to resu@@ me this weekend , with prosecu@@ tors expected to argue that the detention conditions were war@@ ran@@ ted . 
<2en> the P@@ enta@@ g@@ on has maintained that Man@@ ning was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um@@ -@@ cus@@ to@@ dy de@@ tain@@ e@@ es at Qu@@ an@@ tico . 
<2en> coun@@ ts against Man@@ ning include ai@@ ding the enem@@ y , wron@@ g@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defen@@ se information and th@@ eft of public property or records . 
<2en> if he 's convi@@ cted on all coun@@ ts , he could face a life sentence . 
<2en> my Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ American identity crisis 
<2en> he says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there 
<2en> Mexi@@ cans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mexi@@ cans of hard times , he says 
<2en> N@@ av@@ ar@@ re@@ tte says Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans are caught between two wor@@ l@@ ds 
<2en> on a recent trip to Mexico City , I had bar@@ ely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ um@@ ped . 
<2en> signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " Mexi@@ can@@ os " ( " Mexi@@ cans " ) , another for " Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os " ( " For@@ eign@@ ers . " ) 
<2en> I stood there for a few secon@@ ds , un@@ sure of where to go . 
<2en> growing up in Central C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , I had been called a " Mexi@@ can " my entire life . 
<2en> it 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Bo@@ st@@ on refer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . " 
<2en> later , I settled on " Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ American . " 
<2en> but , this was Mexico . 
<2en> and , in the hom@@ eland of my gran@@ d@@ father , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens . 
<2en> I was simply an American . 
<2en> I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an inter@@ view in that language . 
<2en> but I don 't have the vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lary of a na@@ tive , and I can 't sha@@ ke my American accent . 
<2en> so I took my U.S. pass@@ port and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os . 
<2en> I thought about that moment this week when Mexi@@ can presiden@@ t@@ -@@ elec@@ t En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama . 
<2en> on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade . 
<2en> P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to was also e@@ ager to talk about the growth of the Mexi@@ can economy , which is one reason that Mexi@@ cans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States . 
<2en> he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Uni@@ on@@ -@@ style trading bloc in North America . 
<2en> and P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to vo@@ wed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug car@@ tels , even though he offered no specifi@@ cs . 
<2en> for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings . 
<2en> most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States inva@@ ded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rif@@ le . 
<2en> but for Mexi@@ cans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere . 
<2en> so the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexi@@ can press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ing upon their neigh@@ bor 's sovereignty . 
<2en> and the children of Mon@@ te@@ zu@@ ma go on the war@@ path . 
<2en> and yet , for Mexico , the really chall@@ eng@@ ing relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans living in the United States . 
<2en> you want to talk about hard feelings ? 
<2en> there is pl@@ enty . 
<2en> Mexico has winn@@ ers and lo@@ sers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it do@@ es@@ n 't . 
<2en> the only reason you have so many people of Mexi@@ can an@@ ces@@ try living in cities like Los An@@ gel@@ es , L@@ as Ve@@ gas , P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , Den@@ ver or San An@@ ton@@ io is because , at some point in our family tre@@ e , there was a person , maybe a par@@ ent or gran@@ d@@ par@@ ent , who was sh@@ ut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north . 
<2en> and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dar@@ k sk@@ in , little education , from a poor village , etc . 
<2en> we 're their off@@ spring , and we 're loy@@ al to them . 
<2en> not Mexico . 
<2en> and even though we may now be living the American D@@ re@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American D@@ re@@ am we 're living , and not the Mexi@@ can one . 
<2en> our identity might sometimes be fu@@ z@@ zy , but our loy@@ al@@ ty is clear . 
<2en> it 's to the United States . 
<2en> besides , we 're aware that many of the eli@@ te Mexi@@ cans in the ruling class don 't like us . 
<2en> the feeling is mutual . 
<2en> they see us as a remin@@ der of a humili@@ ating defe@@ at and look down on us as inferior stock that is@@ n 't sufficiently Mexi@@ can . 
<2en> our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough . 
<2en> our existence is , as they see it , all about failure . 
<2en> if our families ha@@ dn 't failed in Mexico , they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have left . 
<2en> and we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't now find ourselves tra@@ pped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but lost sou@@ ls nonetheless . 
<2en> my wi@@ fe , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between Mexi@@ cans and Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans because Mexi@@ cans have a fir@@ mer gra@@ s@@ p of who they are and Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans res@@ ent that . 
<2en> while she 's a U.S. citizen , she sees her@@ self as a part of two countries . 
<2en> meanwhile , many Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either . 
<2en> we love listening to the Mexi@@ can band , Los Ti@@ gr@@ es del Norte , but also to Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en . 
<2en> you get the best of both wor@@ l@@ ds , but you 're ro@@ o@@ ted in neither . 
<2en> in Mexico , we 're seen as Americans . 
<2en> and in the United States , we 're considered Mexi@@ can . 
<2en> now , to compli@@ cate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexi@@ can leaders and parts of the intelli@@ gent@@ sia want to recon@@ ne@@ ct with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a . 
<2en> they want to put Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans to work as ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft " ambassa@@ dors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States . 
<2en> we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico . 
<2en> Y@@ e@@ ah . 
<2en> that 's not going to happen . 
<2en> too many hard feelings . 
<2en> and , with income inequality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country . 
<2en> I 'm afraid you 're on your own , amigos . 
<2en> that 's fair . 
<2en> if at least some Mexi@@ cans ar@@ en 't yet ready to for@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexi@@ can@@ -@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that . 
<2en> H@@ mm@@ m . 
<2en> maybe we 're more " Mexi@@ can " than I thought . 
<2en> old bat@@ t@@ les , new Middle East 
<2en> the ce@@ ase@@ fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an un@@ likely foundation for peace 
<2en> can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Je@@ ws in the Middle East ? 
<2en> another round of bloo@@ d@@ shed suggests that any such hope is va@@ in . 
<2en> ami@@ d the usual fu@@ ti@@ le arguments over who started it , scor@@ es of buildings have been reduced to ru@@ b@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missi@@ les from Gaza have lan@@ ded near T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v , Israel 's me@@ tro@@ poli@@ s , and the hol@@ y city of Jerusalem . 
<2en> but though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stu@@ ck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing . 
<2en> the Arab spring has thro@@ wn the pie@@ ces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional tur@@ mo@@ il . 
<2en> maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ di@@ er than before . 
<2en> however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their le@@ th@@ al st@@ alem@@ ate . 
<2en> a war that is neither lost or won 
<2en> at first sight , optimis@@ m looks very hard to justify now . 
<2en> even if the ce@@ ase@@ fire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides . 
<2en> the leaders of Hamas , the Isla@@ mis@@ t movement that has ru@@ led Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing . 
<2en> despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza 's 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most w@@ re@@ t@@ ched and cro@@ w@@ ded cor@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas . 
<2en> indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bit@@ ter ri@@ vals in Fa@@ ta@@ h , the more moder@@ ate Palestinian fac@@ tion . 
<2en> moreover , Hamas 's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side . 
<2en> as Isla@@ mis@@ ts across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends . 
<2en> Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel 's clo@@ s@@ est Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Q@@ a@@ tar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the G@@ ulf states . 
<2en> ju@@ bil@@ ant Hamas people say an Isla@@ mis@@ t c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bu@@ lla@@ h part@@ y@@ -@@ cum@@ -@@ mili@@ tia holds s@@ way , through Syria , where reb@@ els of an increasingly Isla@@ mis@@ t b@@ ent may top@@ ple Bas@@ h@@ ar As@@ sad , and on down through J@@ or@@ dan , where Hamas 's allies are menac@@ ing the king . 
<2en> above all , on Israel 's southern f@@ lan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most popu@@ l@@ ous and pi@@ vo@@ tal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance . 
<2en> H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak , the secu@@ lar des@@ po@@ t who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas . 
<2en> by contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a cou@@ sin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion . 
<2en> in future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an ac@@ tor that cannot be sh@@ ut out even by Israel and America . 
<2en> meanwhile , Israel 's har@@ dl@@ in@@ ers will draw the opposite conclusions . 
<2en> in military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box . 
<2en> Israel 's Ir@@ on Dom@@ e anti@@ -@@ missi@@ le system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missi@@ les have been destroyed . 
<2en> Israelis will sle@@ ep more so@@ und@@ ly - for a while . 
<2en> in diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also bla@@ med Hamas for starting the latest round of violence . 
<2en> above all , Israel has prosper@@ ed , especially under B@@ in@@ y@@ am@@ in Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process . 
<2en> although ro@@ c@@ kets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of sui@@ ci@@ de@@ -@@ bom@@ bers , thanks in part to the bar@@ rier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ un@@ k of a w@@ ou@@ ld@@ -@@ be Palestinian state , and protec@@ ts the Je@@ wish sett@@ lements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law . 
<2en> Mr Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ u , whose Li@@ k@@ ud party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ vig@@ dor Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run@@ -@@ up to an election on January 2@@ 2@@ nd , is sitting pre@@ tty . 
<2en> why co@@ d@@ dle those t@@ wis@@ ty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ? 
<2en> if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire ro@@ c@@ kets , just as their compa@@ tri@@ ots have done in Gaza ? 
<2en> better to keep them behind that wall and s@@ mite them if they raise their heads . 
<2en> maybe the har@@ dl@@ in@@ ers will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calcu@@ lations . 
<2en> even if the Isla@@ mis@@ ts taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home . 
<2en> Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined . 
<2en> starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments men@@ d their economies . 
<2en> that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Bar@@ ack Obama to obtain a ce@@ ase@@ fire aug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something . 
<2en> Israelis too should look to the longer term . 
<2en> with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination is creating a po@@ w@@ der ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus explo@@ ded in T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v this week . 
<2en> repression is already under@@ mining democracy in the Je@@ wish state , and demo@@ graphy exacer@@ ba@@ tes this as the Arab population s@@ w@@ ells . 
<2en> bloo@@ dy missions against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic tol@@ l . 
<2en> both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by out@@ si@@ ders 
<2en> the answer remains the one tr@@ um@@ pe@@ ted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ce@@ ding territory for security . 
<2en> the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ce@@ ase@@ fire will give a little more le@@ ver@@ age to out@@ si@@ ders pus@@ hing that cause . 
<2en> Egypt , which must now set about stop@@ ping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Q@@ a@@ tar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Je@@ wish state based on the 196@@ 7 bound@@ aries with land s@@ w@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem . 
<2en> Arab out@@ si@@ ders should also press Hamas and Fa@@ ta@@ h to come together . 
<2en> that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the im@@ minent bi@@ d for virtual sta@@ te@@ hood at the UN . 
<2en> Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table . 
<2en> during his first term , he negle@@ cted to present his own plan for peace . 
<2en> back in the White House , he is looking just as reluc@@ tant to be drawn in . 
<2en> this is wo@@ e@@ fully short@@ -@@ si@@ ghted . 
<2en> America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East . 
<2en> that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians . 
<2en> cigar@@ ette pla@@ in packaging laws come into force in Australia 
<2en> smoking war@@ nings and dise@@ ased body parts emb@@ la@@ zon@@ ed on du@@ ll green bo@@ xes that are the same for all tobacco bran@@ ds 
<2en> Australia 's world@@ -@@ first laws on cigar@@ ette and tobacco pla@@ in packaging have come into force , re@@ placing br@@ and logos and col@@ ours with gener@@ ic dra@@ b o@@ live green cover@@ ings , gru@@ es@@ om@@ e pic@@ tures of dise@@ ased body parts and de@@ pi@@ ctions of children and bab@@ ies made ill by their parents ' smoking . 
<2en> apart from the var@@ ying health war@@ nings and images the only difference between the pac@@ ks , mandatory from Sat@@ ur@@ day , are the br@@ and names , and these are all prin@@ ted in iden@@ tical small font . 
<2en> it is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco . 
<2en> Australia 's federal government says the aim is to de@@ ter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the hab@@ it of gla@@ m@@ our . 
<2en> it is re@@ lying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up . 
<2en> " even from a very early age you can see that ki@@ ds understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their bran@@ ding , " said the federal health minister , Tan@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , ci@@ ting studies that showed , for example , children lin@@ king a cro@@ wn in a logo with the idea of being a prin@@ cess . 
<2en> while Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multination@@ als ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps . 
<2en> the tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws . 
<2en> tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes . 
<2en> " there will be serious un@@ intended consequences from the legislation , " said Sco@@ tt Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ ac@@ co Australia . 
<2en> counterfe@@ it@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lo@@ ts more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia . 
<2en> others say the laws have bo@@ os@@ ted their business . 
<2en> San@@ dra H@@ a of Zi@@ co Im@@ port P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d , a small family business , said demand for cigar@@ ette cases , si@@ li@@ con covers to ma@@ sk the un@@ pal@@ a@@ table pack@@ ages , had sho@@ t up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tob@@ ac@@ co , Britain 's Im@@ peri@@ al Tob@@ ac@@ co , Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris and Japan Tob@@ ac@@ co lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court . 
<2en> ha said Zi@@ co had sold up to 6@@ ,000 to whol@@ es@@ ale out@@ lets and was a@@ waiting new stock . 
<2en> this is good business for us . 
<2en> the potential h@@ it@@ ch , experts say , is the popu@@ lar@@ ity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targe@@ ting . 
<2en> after a series of Austra@@ li@@ an laws ban@@ ning TV advertising and sports spon@@ sor@@ ship and requiring most s@@ ell@@ ers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online . 
<2en> Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict over@@ seas sites . 
<2en> " if you are a tobacco marke@@ ter and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the comp@@ elling place for you to be in , " said B@@ ec@@ ky Fre@@ em@@ an , a public health resear@@ cher at Sy@@ d@@ ney University . 
<2en> Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in " average Jo@@ e " re@@ views of bran@@ ds on social media sites such as Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , T@@ wit@@ ter and F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok . 
<2en> we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ? 
<2en> British American Tob@@ ac@@ co Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing . 
<2en> the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Hon@@ duras and the Dom@@ ini@@ can Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claim@@ ing at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being un@@ fairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia . 
<2en> a WTO ruling is likely in mid@@ -@@ 2013 . 
<2en> P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging . 
<2en> Canada was the first country to make photo@@ graph war@@ nings mandatory in 2001 . 
<2en> they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine . 
<2en> tou@@ gher laws are being considered in Britain , New Ze@@ al@@ and , South Africa and India . 
<2en> many smo@@ kers in Australia remain defi@@ ant . 
<2en> the pic@@ tures don 't affect me . 
<2en> I just ignore them . 
<2en> " you just gra@@ b a smo@@ ke and put it away , " said Vi@@ c@@ tor El H@@ age as he pur@@ cha@@ sed a pac@@ k with a photo@@ graph of a mouth tum@@ our . 
<2en> hon@@ est@@ ly , there 's only one reason I '@@ d stop , and that 's my little gir@@ l . 
<2en> J@@ ames Y@@ u , who runs the K@@ ing of the Pack tobac@@ con@@ ist in central Sy@@ d@@ ney , said the uniform packaging made it har@@ der to sta@@ ck his sh@@ el@@ ves 
<2en> " it used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Y@@ u said . 
<2en> " the government should have just banned them al@@ together and then we '@@ d go O@@ K , fine , we 're done , we 'll sh@@ ut up shop , " he said , thro@@ wing his hands up in the air .

<2en> so I had pl@@ enty of time to think about the subject of bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> I won 't lie to you . 
<2en> half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pre@@ tty te@@ di@@ ous , even with the dis@@ tra@@ ctions of books , ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines and i@@ P@@ h@@ ones ( not to mention du@@ ty@@ -@@ free sh@@ op@@ ping ) . 
<2en> but increasingly , some acade@@ mi@@ cs and child development experts are coming out in praise of bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> it 's all right for us - and our children - to be bor@@ ed on occasion , they say . 
<2en> it forces the bra@@ in to go on interesting tan@@ gents , perhaps fo@@ ster@@ ing crea@@ tivity . 
<2en> and because most of us are almost consistently plu@@ g@@ ged into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> so should we emb@@ race bor@@ e@@ dom ? 
<2en> Y@@ es . 
<2en> and no . 
<2en> but I 'll get back to that . 
<2en> first of all , like many people , I assu@@ med that bor@@ e@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the ad@@ vent of more leis@@ ure time . 
<2en> not so , says Peter To@@ o@@ he@@ y , a prof@@ essor of Greek and Rom@@ an history at the University of Cal@@ gar@@ y in Canada and the author of " Bor@@ e@@ dom : a Li@@ vely His@@ tory " ( Y@@ ale University Pres@@ s , 2011 ) . 
<2en> " bor@@ e@@ dom actually has a very long history , " he said . 
<2en> there 's Latin gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i about bor@@ e@@ dom on the w@@ alls of P@@ om@@ pe@@ i@@ i dating from the first century . 
<2en> then there 's the question of how we define bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D@@ . E@@ ast@@ wood , an associ@@ ate prof@@ essor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tario , Canada . 
<2en> after looking over the research liter@@ at@@ ure and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bor@@ e@@ dom as an experience of " wan@@ ting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . " 
<2en> what separa@@ tes bor@@ e@@ dom from apa@@ thy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be . 
<2en> with apa@@ thy , he said , there is no urge to do something . 
<2en> the core experience of bor@@ e@@ dom , he said , is " dis@@ ruption of the attention process , associated with a low mo@@ od and a sense that time is passing slowly . " 
<2en> bor@@ e@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like de@@ pression . 
<2en> but Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bor@@ ed tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed see the problem as themselves . 
<2en> sometimes we think we 're bor@@ ed when we just have difficulty concentra@@ ting . 
<2en> in their study , " The un@@ engaged Min@@ d : defining Bor@@ e@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of At@@ tention , " which appeared in the jour@@ nal Perspec@@ tives on P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological Sci@@ ence in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experi@@ ment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine article . 
<2en> some groups heard a loud and un@@ related television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was bar@@ ely noti@@ ce@@ able , while the third group di@@ dn 't hear the so@@ und@@ track at all . 
<2en> the ones who heard the low@@ -@@ level TV reported more bor@@ e@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentra@@ ting but were not sure why , and attribu@@ ted that difficulty to bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> when you 're trying to focus on a difficult or engag@@ ing task , dis@@ ruption of attention can lead to bor@@ e@@ dom , said Mar@@ k J@@ . F@@ ens@@ ke , an associ@@ ate prof@@ essor of ne@@ uro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ p@@ h in On@@ tario and one of the authors of the study . 
<2en> on the other hand , when you 're doing something du@@ ll , " such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a fac@@ tory line , dis@@ trac@@ ting music can help you not be bor@@ ed . " 
<2en> in fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ o@@ dl@@ ing , often seen as a sign of bor@@ e@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally al@@ ert . 
<2en> " research shows that ki@@ ds who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said . 
<2en> we all experience bor@@ e@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a dr@@ on@@ ing speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ous mo@@ vie . 
<2en> but some individuals are more likely to be bor@@ ed than others . 
<2en> to help measure this , researchers developed a " Bor@@ e@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness S@@ c@@ ale " in the 198@@ 0s . 
<2en> the scale includes questions like , " M@@ any things I have to do are repeti@@ tive and mono@@ ton@@ ous , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . " 
<2en> using such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that bo@@ ys tend to be bor@@ ed more often than girls , said Ste@@ p@@ hen Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , a prof@@ essor of psych@@ ology at the University of West F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , especially when it comes nee@@ ding more , and a variety of , external stimu@@ lation . 
<2en> but in general , te@@ en@@ agers are a pre@@ tty ja@@ ded lot . 
<2en> in 1991 , Re@@ ed L@@ ar@@ son , a prof@@ essor of human and community development at the University of I@@ ll@@ in@@ ois , conducted an experi@@ ment in which he contac@@ ted almost 400 te@@ en@@ agers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ ep@@ er . 
<2en> he found that 32 percent of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cents said they were bor@@ ed in school and doing hom@@ e@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bor@@ ed when they wer@@ en 't in school . 
<2en> on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bor@@ ed . 
<2en> prof@@ essor L@@ ar@@ son said he did not know whether the bor@@ e@@ dom per@@ cen@@ tages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower . 
<2en> but he said he did know that " ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cence is a pe@@ ak period for bor@@ e@@ dom , " largely because children and te@@ en@@ agers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do . 
<2en> so back to my original question : is bor@@ e@@ dom good for you ? 
<2en> sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or indul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows . 
<2en> on the other hand , many philosop@@ h@@ ers and writ@@ ers discuss the connection between bor@@ e@@ dom and crea@@ tivity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , who has been stu@@ dying the issue for more than two decades . 
<2en> " bor@@ e@@ dom is the bra@@ in 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said G@@ ary Mar@@ cus , a prof@@ essor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .U@@ . 
<2en> but the bra@@ in do@@ es@@ n 't always know the most appropriate thing to do . 
<2en> if you 're bor@@ ed and use that energy to play gui@@ tar and co@@ ok , it will make you happy . 
<2en> but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term . 
<2en> so if your child is bor@@ ed and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , he may not be bor@@ ed any@@ more , but he has@@ n 't learned how to enter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said . 
<2en> and " that sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said . 
<2en> your k@@ id do@@ es@@ n 't just learn to enter@@ tain himself , but gets more sel@@ f@@ -@@ control in other areas . 
<2en> I don 't think we really want to celeb@@ rate bor@@ e@@ dom . 
<2en> nor should we be too critical of it . 
<2en> rather , our goal should be to feel comfor@@ table away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology . 
<2en> prof@@ essor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed . 
<2en> " we frame it as we need to be bor@@ ed more , but bor@@ e@@ dom is an ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing , res@@ tless desire to be connected with something meaning@@ ful , " he said . 
<2en> what people are really se@@ arch@@ ing for , he said , is a way to un@@ plu@@ g and enjoy down time . 
<2en> " in an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimu@@ lated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ u@@ ts down . " 
<2en> in Col@@ or@@ ado , No Pla@@ y@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law 
<2en> An@@ th@@ ony O@@ roz@@ co , 19 , a community col@@ lege stu@@ dent and so@@ c@@ cer player in sou@@ the@@ astern Col@@ or@@ ado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the poss@@ ession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pi@@ pe he used to smo@@ ke it . 
<2en> Mr. O@@ roz@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in La@@ mar , on the pla@@ ins near the K@@ ans@@ as border , when they were pul@@ led over . 
<2en> after the police offi@@ cer found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car , Mr. O@@ roz@@ co was issued a summ@@ ons for poss@@ ession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ na@@ lia - pe@@ tty offen@@ ses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date . 
<2en> " we get treated like criminals , " Mr. O@@ roz@@ co said . 
<2en> but is he one ? 
<2en> in the un@@ certain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado 's vote to leg@@ ali@@ ze small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana for rec@@ re@@ ational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location . 
<2en> hundreds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dro@@ pped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure . 
<2en> police de@@ partments have stopped char@@ ging adul@@ ts 21 years and older for sm@@ all@@ -@@ scale poss@@ ession that will be legally san@@ ction@@ ed once the laws take effect in the coming weeks . 
<2en> but prosecu@@ tors in more conserva@@ tive pre@@ cin@@ c@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ado have vo@@ wed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still ci@@ ting people for poss@@ ession . 
<2en> at the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver sub@@ ur@@ bs to the Western moun@@ tains are voting to block new , sta@@ te@@ -@@ licen@@ sed re@@ tail mari@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities . 
<2en> " this thing is evol@@ ving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said D@@ ani@@ el J@@ . O@@ ates , the police ch@@ ief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of Den@@ ver . 
<2en> regula@@ tors in Washington State are also s@@ cra@@ tch@@ ing their heads . 
<2en> and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licen@@ ses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of De@@ c . 1 , 2013 . 
<2en> they say that Col@@ or@@ ado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now rec@@ re@@ ation@@ ally . 
<2en> " Col@@ or@@ ado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said Bri@@ an E@@ . S@@ mit@@ h , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board . 
<2en> but no place or system , Mr. S@@ mit@@ h conce@@ ded , can do more than suggest what might work . 
<2en> " there 's no real precedent for us to follow , " he said . 
<2en> Washington 's law , called I@@ -@@ 50@@ 2 , takes effect on De@@ c . 6 , which also leaves a year of lim@@ bo during which the state li@@ cens@@ ing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized poss@@ ession will . 
<2en> and there are thor@@ ny mechan@@ ical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mandate of " adequate access " to licen@@ sed mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohibi@@ tions on can@@ nab@@ is businesses within 1@@ ,000 fe@@ et of a school , par@@ k , pla@@ y@@ ground or child care center . 
<2en> " no@@ where will it be more difficult to site a licen@@ sed can@@ nab@@ is business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan area , " said B@@ en Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Center for Legal Can@@ nab@@ is , a recently formed research group . 
<2en> on No@@ v . 21 , Chi@@ ef O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e@@ -@@ mail announ@@ cing that the city at@@ tor@@ ney would no longer be prosecu@@ ting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop char@@ ging people for those crimes " effective immediately . " 
<2en> Chi@@ ef O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ wers , and that they would still pursue drug traffi@@ ck@@ ers and deal@@ ers . 
<2en> in northern Col@@ or@@ ado 's W@@ eld Coun@@ ty , the distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ney , K@@ en Bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view . 
<2en> after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana poss@@ ession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment . 
<2en> right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , though many are facing other charges . 
<2en> " our office has an obligation to prosecu@@ te offen@@ ses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement . 
<2en> the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa Coun@@ ty , where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initiative . 
<2en> the police in Gr@@ and Jun@@ ction , the coun@@ ty 's largest city , are no longer ci@@ ting adul@@ ts for poss@@ ession of small amounts . 
<2en> the coun@@ ty 's distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ney , Pe@@ te Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dis@@ miss all of the pending poss@@ ession cases . 
<2en> " I do not think I 'm wa@@ sting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , " he said . 
<2en> although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ado voters supported the measure , bringing rec@@ re@@ ational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple . 
<2en> and the contradic@@ tory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state 's big green experi@@ ment . 
<2en> " it 's a cultural bar@@ rier " with distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys , said Se@@ an Mc@@ Al@@ lis@@ ter , a Den@@ ver law@@ yer who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana defen@@ dants and is a local spo@@ kes@@ man for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws . 
<2en> " they spent so much of their lives prosecu@@ ting people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said . 
<2en> as the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ado and Washington are po@@ ised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ aliz@@ ation . 
<2en> as advo@@ cates and state officials plan for a new fronti@@ er of leg@@ alized sales , they are also an@@ xi@@ ously a@@ waiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultiv@@ ation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes . 
<2en> advo@@ cates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice De@@ partment yi@@ elds . 
<2en> despite some high@@ -@@ profile arres@@ ts of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and s@@ ell@@ ers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ado , Washington and 16 other states . 
<2en> while drug agents will probably not be@@ at down doors to se@@ ize a small ba@@ g of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the sta@@ te@@ -@@ regulated rec@@ re@@ ational mari@@ ju@@ ana shops allowed under the new laws , said K@@ ev@@ in A@@ . Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy advis@@ er in the Obama administration . 
<2en> several cities in Col@@ or@@ ado are not waiting for federal authorities to act . 
<2en> even before E@@ lection Day , some local governments approved moratori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open . 
<2en> last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six@@ -@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week . 
<2en> " we don 't want to be put in a position where we licen@@ se som@@ ebo@@ dy and then have a big federal issue , " said B@@ ob Nichol@@ son , a City Council member . 
<2en> our community voted against this amendment . 
<2en> we 're looking at what the community voted for ver@@ sus what the state voted for . 
<2en> there 's an aw@@ ful lot of questions . 
<2en> Pe@@ tron@@ ella W@@ y@@ at@@ t : I was bu@@ lli@@ ed out of O@@ x@@ ford for being a T@@ ory 
<2en> it is not just today 's university students who are atta@@ cked for their views 
<2en> I can 't remember a time when I di@@ dn 't dream of win@@ ning a place at O@@ x@@ ford University . 
<2en> both my father and my el@@ der bro@@ ther had been at what I imagin@@ ed was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a modern@@ -@@ day win@@ e@@ -@@ bl@@ us@@ hed Greek sym@@ posi@@ um encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance . 
<2en> yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Ei@@ gh@@ ties to read history , I '@@ d pac@@ ked my bag@@ s , preci@@ pi@@ ta@@ ting the first scandal of my life . 
<2en> my father bro@@ ke down and cri@@ ed . 
<2en> friends were ba@@ ff@@ led . 
<2en> the E@@ ven@@ ing Standar@@ d di@@ ary claimed I '@@ d qu@@ it because I objec@@ ted to fellow under@@ gradu@@ ates having sex in the room next to mine . 
<2en> the writ@@ er A N Wil@@ son announced w@@ ag@@ gis@@ h@@ ly that I '@@ d depar@@ ted because I was forced to drin@@ k out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs . 
<2en> the truth was less dro@@ ll . 
<2en> I ran away . 
<2en> Y@@ es , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bu@@ ll@@ ying and intimi@@ dation . 
<2en> not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school . 
<2en> I was persecu@@ ted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment it was both bi@@ go@@ ted and barbari@@ c : my father , the late Wo@@ o@@ dro@@ w W@@ y@@ at@@ t , was a high@@ -@@ profile advis@@ er to Mar@@ gar@@ et Tha@@ t@@ cher and I was a Conserva@@ tive supporter . 
<2en> why bring this up now , you might ask . 
<2en> well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Ri@@ ght@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution . 
<2en> such is the institution@@ alised and increasing ha@@ tre@@ d of T@@ ory students at O@@ x@@ ford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al@@ -@@ rights protection as ga@@ ys , disabled people and ethnic minorities . 
<2en> Conserva@@ tive members of Cor@@ pus Chr@@ is@@ ti College 's j@@ uni@@ or common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are " often actively isolated , personally atta@@ cked and made to feel un@@ welcome " because of their political views . 
<2en> they want to create a post on the col@@ lege 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be ai@@ red freely . 
<2en> their situation was@@ n 't helped by a recent B@@ BC T@@ wo docu@@ mentary , W@@ onder@@ land : young , B@@ right and on the Ri@@ ght , about stu@@ dent politics , which por@@ tra@@ yed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ b@@ alls and neo@@ -@@ Na@@ z@@ is . 
<2en> it fea@@ tured gradu@@ ate Jo@@ e Co@@ o@@ ke , former president of the O@@ x@@ ford University Conserva@@ tive Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a Rol@@ l@@ s@@ -@@ Roy@@ ce , spor@@ ting a sil@@ ver suit and sil@@ ver@@ -@@ top@@ ped can@@ e . 
<2en> at other universities , Conserva@@ tive students say they are being treated as " s@@ ca@@ pe@@ go@@ ats " for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition fe@@ es . " 
<2en> Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , vi@@ ce@@ -@@ president of No@@ tt@@ ing@@ ham University Conserva@@ tive Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing L@@ ef@@ t@@ -@@ wing bi@@ as at universities . 
<2en> people assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don C@@ lu@@ b without meeting us . " 
<2en> Sam@@ u@@ el Ro@@ ber@@ ts , 21 , a history stu@@ dent at Cor@@ pus Chr@@ is@@ ti , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " un@@ comfor@@ table , " while Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elec@@ t of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterior@@ ation in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Ri@@ ght of centre . 
<2en> " this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says . 
<2en> I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at O@@ x@@ ford . 
<2en> I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old . 
<2en> ha@@ tre@@ d of the Conserva@@ tive Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le . 
<2en> the year before , the university had voted to refuse Mar@@ gar@@ et Tha@@ t@@ cher - a former stu@@ dent - an honor@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding . 
<2en> the atmosphere would have made a S@@ tal@@ in@@ ist sh@@ u@@ d@@ der with ap@@ prehen@@ sion . 
<2en> during the first few days of fres@@ h@@ ers " week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the dons , I had a ta@@ ste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come . 
<2en> I was to find that the dons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ un@@ ting of T@@ ory under@@ gradu@@ ates but took part with re@@ lis@@ h . 
<2en> the politics of the min@@ ers " strike , privatisation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against apar@@ thei@@ d South Africa were brought into the wo@@ od@@ -@@ pan@@ elled ro@@ oms of the tu@@ tori@@ al . 
<2en> my first one involved trans@@ lating 18@@ th@@ -@@ century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed . 
<2en> " Mis@@ s W@@ y@@ at@@ t , " said the don , Har@@ ry P@@ itt ( now de@@ ce@@ ased ) , " please trans@@ late the first paragraph . " 
<2en> I st@@ um@@ bled over it . 
<2en> a small man with a face like ca@@ ke bat@@ ter , P@@ itt was big on bile . 
<2en> " do Tha@@ t@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stu@@ pi@@ d ? " he demanded . 
<2en> the other under@@ gradu@@ ates gi@@ g@@ gle@@ d . 
<2en> te@@ ars pri@@ cked the back of my eyes . 
<2en> " I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spar@@ e time - that is , if you 're not too bus@@ y socialis@@ ing , " P@@ itt s@@ nar@@ led . 
<2en> I wal@@ ked back to my ro@@ oms a dis@@ con@@ so@@ late figure . 
<2en> at din@@ ner in col@@ lege that evening I s@@ at by myself ; then I felt a light ta@@ p on my shoul@@ der . 
<2en> it was a secon@@ d@@ -@@ year English stu@@ dent named J@@ ames who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A . 
<2en> " I know who you are , " he said k@@ ind@@ ly . 
<2en> I 'm afraid it 's like that . 
<2en> anyone suspec@@ ted of being a T@@ ory is pi@@ cked on . 
<2en> it 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Mar@@ gar@@ et Tha@@ t@@ cher , so it will be worse for you . 
<2en> most T@@ ory fres@@ h@@ ers pre@@ tend they 're Labour . 
<2en> later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attemp@@ ted to dis@@ si@@ mu@@ late . 
<2en> I insis@@ ted that I di@@ dn 't agree with everything Mrs Tha@@ t@@ cher said . 
<2en> this plo@@ y proved un@@ successful . 
<2en> a first year PPE stu@@ dent , who , ir@@ oni@@ cally , had been to E@@ ton , said : " you 're the dau@@ ghter of a fas@@ c@@ ist pi@@ g . " 
<2en> you 're contamin@@ ated . 
<2en> other students took up the refra@@ in . 
<2en> I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dir@@ ty . 
<2en> " how do T@@ ories have sex ? " one asked . 
<2en> they be@@ at each other , don 't they ? 
<2en> I felt the way homosexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Si@@ x@@ ties . 
<2en> would I ever be able to lead a normal life at O@@ x@@ ford ? 
<2en> would I be forced to meet like@@ -@@ min@@ ded people only after dar@@ k ? 
<2en> would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural incl@@ in@@ ations ? 
<2en> the three years before me stre@@ t@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ cis@@ m and isolation . 
<2en> the only openly T@@ ory don was Nor@@ man St@@ one , Professor of Mo@@ dern His@@ tory , who was based at my col@@ lege . 
<2en> he was ha@@ ted for being not only a Conserva@@ tive but a foreign policy advis@@ er to Tha@@ t@@ cher and one of her speech writ@@ ers . 
<2en> he was hardly ever there . 
<2en> he lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provin@@ cial and pe@@ tty , and for its adher@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ ist@@ -@@ determin@@ ist view of history . 
<2en> in 1997 he took up a profes@@ sor@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey . 
<2en> " you won 't be happy here , " he told me . 
<2en> I began com@@ mu@@ ting from O@@ x@@ ford to my parents " house in London , finding refu@@ ge with my more open@@ -@@ min@@ ded me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan friends and family . 
<2en> I told my father I ha@@ ted O@@ x@@ ford and why . 
<2en> he was incre@@ dul@@ ous . 
<2en> during his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted . 
<2en> " but it 's the best place in the world , " he said pa@@ the@@ tically . 
<2en> they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do that , not among my dre@@ aming sp@@ ires . 
<2en> even my Communist friends always had im@@ pec@@ cable man@@ ners . 
<2en> his r@@ heu@@ my eyes began to cl@@ ou@@ d . 
<2en> give it a chance . 
<2en> I 'm sure it 's all just a te@@ ase . 
<2en> it would break my heart if you left . 
<2en> exhaus@@ ted by my frequent tri@@ ps to London , my emo@@ tional resistance was deterior@@ ating . 
<2en> a male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory supporter , had suc@@ cum@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ oun@@ ced his cre@@ ed . 
<2en> during a tu@@ tori@@ al the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seri@@ ousness , that I was an " enem@@ y of the people , " I decided to do the same . 
<2en> in@@ war@@ dly bl@@ us@@ hing with shame , I ad@@ mitted to being " bra@@ in@@ was@@ hed by my parents " and called them " old fo@@ ols . " 
<2en> the res@@ pi@@ te was short . 
<2en> it was my father who dro@@ ve the na@@ il into the co@@ ff@@ in of my O@@ x@@ ford career . 
<2en> at the time , he wrote two col@@ um@@ ns in the M@@ ur@@ doch press each week . 
<2en> my door was lo@@ cked . 
<2en> I co@@ wer@@ ed inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up . 
<2en> when they left , I pac@@ ked a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London . 
<2en> I never went back . 
<2en> you may call me a s@@ ni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp . 
<2en> but no 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old should be subject to such intimi@@ dation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution . 
<2en> even more tragic is that it was O@@ x@@ ford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill@@ -@@ de@@ served reputation for equality and freedom of thought . 
<2en> " Val@@ ent@@ ino prefer@@ s ele@@ gan@@ ce to no@@ tor@@ ie@@ ty " 
<2en> on the occasion of the " Val@@ ent@@ ino : Ma@@ ster of C@@ ou@@ ture , " an exhibi@@ tion that opened this week in London , A@@ BC speaks with N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Th@@ y@@ ss@@ en@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ za and other of the Italian de@@ signer 's famous clients . 
<2en> Som@@ er@@ set House , former home of Qu@@ e@@ en E@@ liz@@ abe@@ th I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of ho@@ sting a Val@@ ent@@ ino Gar@@ avan@@ i exhibi@@ tion . 
<2en> during the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration of " Val@@ ent@@ ino : Ma@@ ster of C@@ ou@@ ture , " the de@@ signer acknowledged a retro@@ spec@@ tive apo@@ the@@ o@@ sis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture go@@ wns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years . 
<2en> " I love this pal@@ ace " he says , in his un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able Italian accent . 
<2en> this exhibi@@ tion is the culmin@@ ation of a story whose only protagon@@ ist is " sign@@ ore " Gar@@ avan@@ i , although it could not have been written without his distingu@@ ished clients . 
<2en> Val@@ ent@@ ino has always been fas@@ cin@@ ated by the r@@ are@@ fied and dis@@ tant world of the no@@ bility . 
<2en> in the first room of the exhibi@@ tion , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and pho@@ tos signed by the cre@@ am of ar@@ isto@@ cra@@ cy , from Pr@@ in@@ cess S@@ ali@@ ma@@ h A@@ ga K@@ han , Lord S@@ no@@ w@@ don , Pr@@ in@@ cess Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Chan@@ tal of Greece to Mar@@ gar@@ et of England . 
<2en> Val@@ ent@@ ino exhi@@ b@@ its these personal mem@@ ories as if they were tro@@ p@@ hi@@ es of his social as@@ cent from hu@@ m@@ ble cou@@ tur@@ ier in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ do@@ l of the international je@@ t@@ -@@ set . 
<2en> there is nothing wrong with lo@@ ving ro@@ y@@ al@@ ty . 
<2en> " at least they don 't drop cigar@@ ette ends on your magnifi@@ cent car@@ pe@@ t , like some beautiful po@@ p music celeb@@ ri@@ ties do , " says Baroness Fi@@ ona Th@@ y@@ ss@@ en@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ za . 
<2en> in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 7@@ 0s , we both lived in the Al@@ ps and were good friends . 
<2en> Val@@ ent@@ ino is a specta@@ cular host whose enter@@ tains with gener@@ o@@ sity and ele@@ gan@@ ce . 
<2en> " we all lo@@ ved being invited to his ch@@ al@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad " says " H@@ ein@@ i " Th@@ y@@ ssen 's ex@@ -@@ wi@@ fe , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as Mar@@ ella A@@ gn@@ elli and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ ar@@ chos . 
<2en> Val@@ ent@@ ino has always preferred ele@@ gan@@ ce to no@@ tor@@ ie@@ ty . 
<2en> and yet , he is a star . 
<2en> Val@@ eria Ma@@ z@@ za , we@@ aring a Val@@ ent@@ ino . 
<2en> the Ar@@ gent@@ ine model Val@@ eria Ma@@ z@@ za also rec@@ alls the cou@@ tur@@ ier 's char@@ is@@ ma . 
<2en> many years ago , after a fashion show in Pi@@ az@@ za di S@@ pa@@ gna in Rome , we went for din@@ ner at his fla@@ t . 
<2en> there were twenty of us , including Sharon St@@ one and John Ken@@ ne@@ dy J@@ r . 
<2en> you could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the fla@@ t and its dec@@ or , the food and the music . 
<2en> " all the guests were made to feel important and lo@@ ved " rec@@ alls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te C@@ ou@@ ture We@@ ek Paris , in 1995 . 
<2en> " his de@@ signs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she concludes . 
<2en> no@@ bility para@@ de 
<2en> Gar@@ avan@@ i 's life is not a story of ob@@ session , but of well recipro@@ cated love . 
<2en> he lo@@ ves w@@ ell@@ -@@ edu@@ cated people who come from good back@@ grounds , and they love him . 
<2en> one of the Som@@ er@@ set House g@@ all@@ eries has been trans@@ formed into a gla@@ mor@@ ous , six@@ ty@@ -@@ foot long ca@@ t@@ walk which offers a role re@@ versal : visitors take the place of the models and have to para@@ de down the ca@@ t@@ walk while looking at a dream " audi@@ ence " we@@ aring Val@@ ent@@ ino ma@@ ster@@ pie@@ ces , for example , the dres@@ s Jack@@ ie Ken@@ ne@@ dy chose for her we@@ d@@ ding with Ar@@ is@@ tot@@ le On@@ as@@ sis , the co@@ stu@@ me Mon@@ ica V@@ it@@ ti wor@@ e in " La No@@ tte " and the wo@@ ol and lea@@ ther co@@ at that belon@@ ged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ ba . 
<2en> in this cro@@ w@@ d of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ bil@@ la of Luxembourg , G@@ l@@ oria von Th@@ ur@@ n und Ta@@ xis , M@@ et@@ te@@ -@@ Mar@@ it of Nor@@ way , R@@ os@@ ario of Bulgaria and So@@ fia of Hab@@ s@@ burg . 
<2en> N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal and the de@@ signer , in 2006 
<2en> many of these clients say your first Val@@ ent@@ ino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . " 
<2en> I remember it perfectly . 
<2en> it was a pair of tro@@ users , a sh@@ ir@@ t , a " gi@@ let " wa@@ ist@@ co@@ at and jac@@ ket from the 197@@ 1@@ -@@ 197@@ 2 au@@ tum@@ n@@ -@@ win@@ ter collection . 
<2en> " it was a gi@@ ft he gave me " says N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the de@@ signer 's mus@@ es . 
<2en> " I prefer him to other de@@ sign@@ ers because of his fem@@ in@@ in@@ ity , his great love of women , and because he enhan@@ ces our beau@@ ty " added the former Du@@ ch@@ ess of F@@ eria . 
<2en> I love the col@@ ours he uses , they really stand out and " l@@ end themselves " to your face . 
<2en> their proportions are perfect . 
<2en> the prin@@ cess and fashion advis@@ or Patri@@ cia del@@ la Gi@@ ov@@ am@@ pa@@ ola d '@@ A@@ ren@@ berg also rem@@ embers the first time she wor@@ e a Val@@ ent@@ ino . 
<2en> as a te@@ en@@ ager living in Italy , I dre@@ am@@ ed of reaching the age when I '@@ d have the chance to we@@ ar one of his evening go@@ wns ... 
<2en> my time finally came in the late ' 9@@ 0s . 
<2en> I b@@ ought my first Val@@ ent@@ ino dres@@ s to we@@ ar at a party in the ca@@ st@@ le belon@@ ging to my cou@@ sin , Pr@@ in@@ ce E@@ dou@@ ard de Li@@ gne . 
<2en> it was a red dres@@ s , with a fr@@ il@@ ly sk@@ ir@@ t , dra@@ ped " cor@@ sage " and a st@@ rap@@ less ne@@ ck@@ line . 
<2en> " it was a dream come true " says Pr@@ in@@ cess D '@@ A@@ ren@@ berg , the wi@@ dow of R@@ od@@ ri@@ go d '@@ A@@ ren@@ berg . 
<2en> " Val@@ ent@@ ino is in@@ different to fashion , his ob@@ session is tim@@ eless " says this Italian ar@@ isto@@ cra@@ t who lives between Paris , New York and Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ ires . 
<2en> Pr@@ in@@ cess D '@@ A@@ ren@@ berg looks after her cou@@ tur@@ ier go@@ wns with " the utmost care ... because a dres@@ s not just a dres@@ s , it 's also the many mem@@ ories that go with it . " 
<2en> the " king " of fashion 
<2en> the " grand finale " of the Som@@ er@@ set House exhibi@@ tion is Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Chan@@ tal Mil@@ ler 's we@@ d@@ ding dres@@ s from her mar@@ ri@@ age to Paul of Greece in 1995 . 
<2en> it took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the de@@ signer calls his se@@ am@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ en@@ cr@@ usted , i@@ vor@@ y@@ -@@ col@@ ou@@ red sil@@ k go@@ wn with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half me@@ tres long . 
<2en> according to journ@@ alist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the speci@@ alist press , that dres@@ s represents a high fashion mil@@ est@@ one of the late 20@@ th century , " the return of high society clients . " 
<2en> da@@ z@@ z@@ led for years with the " sa@@ vo@@ ir@@ -@@ être " of the eli@@ te , Val@@ ent@@ ino is now its fin@@ est expon@@ ent . 
<2en> C@@ av@@ ali@@ ere di Gran Cro@@ ce ( the high@@ est@@ -@@ ran@@ king distinction in Italy ) , C@@ av@@ ali@@ ere del La@@ vor@@ o , Com@@ man@@ deur de L '@@ Or@@ dre des Ar@@ ts et des Let@@ tres , and awarded the Legi@@ on of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ avan@@ i accumu@@ lates as many hon@@ ours as any of his clients ' hus@@ ban@@ ds . 
<2en> " I 've always been struck by his re@@ fin@@ ed and cal@@ m manner , and his ne@@ at and perfect appearance " acknowled@@ ges D '@@ A@@ ren@@ berg . 
<2en> the last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala din@@ ner at the Or@@ say M@@ use@@ um . 
<2en> he was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jac@@ quel@@ ine de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine . 
<2en> " he was im@@ ma@@ cu@@ late , time stands still for him . " 
<2en> if a prin@@ cess says that ... 
<2en> the har@@ dest job in the world : the human mu@@ les of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen 
<2en> for four euros , the Indon@@ esi@@ an vol@@ can@@ o por@@ ters risk life and lim@@ b carrying 70 ki@@ los of sul@@ ph@@ ur along ste@@ ep stone pa@@ ths . 
<2en> there are people for whom work is hel@@ l , and others who - liter@@ ally - work in hel@@ l . 
<2en> this is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ ja@@ ya , one of the 400 min@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o , east of the Indon@@ esi@@ an island of J@@ ava . 
<2en> to do so , he has to des@@ c@@ end every day to the bottom of the cra@@ ter , where the sul@@ ph@@ uro@@ us gas em@@ an@@ ating from the bo@@ wel@@ s of the earth soli@@ difi@@ es on contact with air . 
<2en> after breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur ro@@ cks , which in total can wei@@ gh up to 70 ki@@ los , he carri@@ es them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ kets on his shoul@@ ders along the ste@@ ep stone pa@@ ths . 
<2en> it is only 250 me@@ tres to the top of the vol@@ can@@ o , which ris@@ es to 2,@@ 3@@ 86 me@@ tres above sea level , but the exhaus@@ ted por@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sna@@ il 's pace , keeping their balance and meas@@ uring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the preci@@ pi@@ ce . 
<2en> they know that one sli@@ p could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who pl@@ un@@ ged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen cli@@ ffs . 
<2en> the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen min@@ ers are paid 5 euro cents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur removed . 
<2en> once at the top , they make their way past the tour@@ ists who photo@@ graph them like circu@@ s mon@@ ke@@ ys and then , lu@@ g@@ ging their heavy bas@@ kets , they walk three kilome@@ tres to the sc@@ ales inst@@ alled by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 8@@ 50 me@@ tres above sea level . 
<2en> this is PT N@@ gri@@ m@@ bi C@@ and@@ i , a company which , since 19@@ 60 , has been explo@@ iting the vol@@ can@@ o , and quite liter@@ ally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro cents ) per kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur . 
<2en> it then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 cents ) to the petro@@ chemical industry , as the miner@@ al is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufac@@ ture of mat@@ ches , fi@@ re@@ works , cos@@ me@@ tics , dyna@@ mite and even for wh@@ it@@ ening sugar . 
<2en> " we generally carry 70 ki@@ los , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.@@ 8 euros ) a trip " expla@@ ins An@@ to , who usually make three tri@@ ps a day . 
<2en> each one takes three hours and you end up exhaus@@ ted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day . 
<2en> although it seems a pit@@ tance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would ear@@ n in the field . 
<2en> " min@@ ers ' wages are very high here , whereas co@@ ffe@@ e har@@ v@@ esting is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the average mon@@ thly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 euros ) " expla@@ ins the porter , who previously worked as a ma@@ son in the island resort of Bali . 
<2en> there , his wage was 7@@ 5@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to Ban@@ y@@ u@@ wan@@ g@@ i , a village near the vol@@ can@@ o , for a comp@@ elling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ ri@@ ding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur : " I mar@@ ried a gir@@ l from Bali , where they are Hin@@ du , and I 've brought her to J@@ ava to conver@@ t to Islam . " 
<2en> An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty bre@@ a@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are irri@@ ta@@ ted by the toxic gases . 
<2en> at 27 years old , An@@ to has been ris@@ king his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o , and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its tol@@ l on him , even though he covers his face with special ma@@ sk and go@@ g@@ g@@ les . 
<2en> he has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty bre@@ a@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are irri@@ ta@@ ted by the toxic gases from the vol@@ can@@ o . 
<2en> this is the price you have to pay to realise your dre@@ ams . 
<2en> " I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he vo@@ ws in more than acceptable English . 
<2en> punished for life , this pleas@@ ant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le . 
<2en> sharing a fil@@ thy wo@@ o@@ den hu@@ t with other por@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur do@@ es@@ n 't stop f@@ low@@ ing at night , when its character@@ istic y@@ el@@ low col@@ our turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dar@@ k . 
<2en> def@@ ying the sha@@ dows , An@@ to descen@@ ds the cra@@ ter and li@@ ghts the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the hel@@ met he b@@ ought with his money . 
<2en> some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur bas@@ kets on their shoul@@ ders from the cra@@ ter . 
<2en> despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ ur extra@@ ction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the por@@ ters , who work for themselves and by the kil@@ o . 
<2en> in fact , they do not even see any of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 2.@@ 5 euro ) per ca@@ mera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.@@ 2 euro ) entr@@ ance fe@@ e , the guar@@ ds of this natural reserve charge to tour@@ ists who come to photo@@ graph the vol@@ can@@ o and their human mu@@ les . 
<2en> " this work is for animals , not people " protests Mad@@ ru@@ sin , a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year porter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen for three decades , since leaving school . 
<2en> he can li@@ ft up to 110 ki@@ los , ensuring that he will go on working " all he can " because he needs the money to edu@@ cate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old . 
<2en> I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life . 
<2en> although the sul@@ ph@@ ur bur@@ ns your thro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the min@@ ers in the thi@@ ck col@@ um@@ ns of smo@@ ke coming out of the vol@@ can@@ o , they are so har@@ dy that no@@ -@@ one compla@@ ins of serious ill@@ nesses ... apart , of course , from their common res@@ pira@@ tory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ri@@ tis , k@@ ne@@ e pain and s@@ ores on the shoul@@ ders , which have been miss@@ hap@@ en by the weight of the bas@@ kets . 
<2en> balan@@ cing the bas@@ ket on his back , U@@ na@@ ini@@ k can only carry 50 ki@@ los now he is 53 years old . 
<2en> every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the vol@@ can@@ o , which three lor@@ ries move to the war@@ eh@@ ouse in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilome@@ tres away along a go@@ at path that pas@@ ses through scru@@ bl@@ and . 
<2en> " I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life " says U@@ na@@ ini@@ k , opening a mouth full of gaps where te@@ e@@ th use to be . 
<2en> the ol@@ dest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur . 
<2en> time pas@@ ses , but poverty perpe@@ tu@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world : the one done by human mu@@ les in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o . 
<2en> Sing@@ apor@@ e seeks bab@@ ies to save its economy 
<2en> Sing@@ apor@@ e@@ ans blame their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children . 
<2en> " Sing@@ apor@@ e 's population needs to grow . " 
<2en> I 'm a patri@@ o@@ tic hus@@ band , you 're my patri@@ o@@ tic wi@@ fe , let 's do our civi@@ c duty and create life ! 
<2en> it may seem un@@ likely that these ver@@ ses are part of an adver@@ t for min@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went vi@@ ral on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be in Sing@@ apor@@ e earlier this year . 
<2en> the phra@@ ses are part of a ra@@ p and make use of local references such as " L@@ et 's put a ba@@ o ( b@@ un ) in the ov@@ en " to make f@@ un of the birth rate in Sing@@ apor@@ e . 
<2en> the advertising company that made the video , B@@ B@@ H , is hope@@ ful that the adver@@ ti@@ sement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a f@@ un way . 
<2en> its creative director , D@@ ou@@ g@@ las Ha@@ mil@@ ton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . " 
<2en> it 's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it f@@ un and am@@ using . 
<2en> it 's the biggest problem facing this country . 
<2en> we are the world 's worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address . 
<2en> we knew the Government had tried many things , like laun@@ ching per@@ fu@@ mes with pher@@ om@@ ones or organis@@ ing speed dating even@@ ings . 
<2en> many of these ideas may have been creative , but they di@@ dn 't necessarily work . 
<2en> so we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by compos@@ ing a ra@@ p ? 
<2en> 1.@@ 2 children 
<2en> but the Sing@@ apor@@ e Government is not taking it so li@@ ghtly . 
<2en> it spen@@ ds USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children . 
<2en> a government package for mar@@ ri@@ ages and parents grants up to USD 15@@ ,000 per child , exten@@ ds matern@@ ity leave and distribu@@ tes tax benefits . 
<2en> but this has all had little effect . 
<2en> Sing@@ apor@@ e is a rich , high technology city State in Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , also known for the conserva@@ tism of its leaders and its strict social controls . 
<2en> the birth rate in Sing@@ apor@@ e , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.@@ 2 children per woman . 
<2en> the last time it was over 2 , known as the re@@ placement rate , was in 197@@ 6 . 
<2en> so why are Sing@@ apor@@ e@@ ans not having children ? 
<2en> T@@ an We@@ i M@@ ing , Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Fa@@ mi@@ ly Policy of the National Popu@@ lation Di@@ vision , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . " 
<2en> " this has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting mar@@ ried and starting a family " he expla@@ ins . 
<2en> these changes in social nor@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and dela@@ ying mar@@ ri@@ age and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Sing@@ apor@@ e . 
<2en> meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dra@@ matically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created res@@ ent@@ ment among the local population . 
<2en> in Sing@@ apor@@ e , there are web@@ sites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly dis@@ gu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating . 
<2en> increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Sing@@ apor@@ e ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence . 
<2en> since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vies for foreign workers . 
<2en> un@@ expected consequences 
<2en> while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax reven@@ ues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Sing@@ apor@@ e 's case there are also some un@@ expected consequences . 
<2en> the Government is trying not to build so many small houses . 
<2en> for example , it has started to influence the real esta@@ te sector . 
<2en> its urban development authority has started to control the number of small a@@ partments , known as " sho@@ e bo@@ xes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city . 
<2en> these a@@ partments have a surface of 46 squ@@ are me@@ tres and have been very successful in terms of sales . 
<2en> however , there is concern that they may promote a sin@@ gle@@ -@@ living li@@ fest@@ yle and dis@@ courage develop@@ ers who want to build large family houses . 
<2en> but , L@@ im Y@@ e@@ w So@@ on , managing director of the real esta@@ te company EL Develop@@ ers , says his " sho@@ e bo@@ xes " sell much faster than larger units . 
<2en> they are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units . 
<2en> this means they are much better for our cash flow . 
<2en> however , he ad@@ mits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to develop@@ ers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project . 
<2en> too stressed 
<2en> Sing@@ apor@@ e is a city State . 
<2en> although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apor@@ e@@ ans working in the central financial distric@@ t , it seems they will not have much impact . 
<2en> " people are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive . 
<2en> other people can have children . 
<2en> " but , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old . 
<2en> men and women ali@@ ke mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children . 
<2en> so , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to bab@@ ies , the Sing@@ apor@@ e@@ ans have the last word . 
<2en> what is private off@@ line is private online 
<2en> privacy . 
<2en> according to the Spanish Roy@@ al A@@ ca@@ de@@ my Di@@ ction@@ ary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . " 
<2en> what is privacy for an under 16 ? 
<2en> how do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ? 
<2en> do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by air@@ ing information over the Internet which they probably would not share off@@ line ? 
<2en> el@@ P@@ eri@@ ódi@@ co inter@@ viewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users . 
<2en> in four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and pass@@ word " when applied to social networks . 
<2en> " I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't up@@ load my deep@@ est secre@@ ts in a post " says J@@ or@@ ge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok , T@@ wit@@ ter , Ho@@ t@@ mail and Windows Li@@ ve Mes@@ sen@@ ger , with which he has had accounts for two years . 
<2en> " they are very secret secre@@ ts , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says . 
<2en> on F@@ B I up@@ load nice pic@@ tures or games . 
<2en> and I have f@@ un with people I know . 
<2en> " I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't share a p@@ hoto that is@@ n 't mine , or that belongs to som@@ ebo@@ dy who 's doing something stu@@ pi@@ d " he says . 
<2en> the child recognises that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pic@@ tures of na@@ ked people , crimes , or write humili@@ ating or aggressive comments . 
<2en> J@@ or@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine fol@@ lo@@ wers on T@@ wit@@ ter . 
<2en> most are relatives . 
<2en> his mother is included , and she has the pass@@ word to one of the accounts . 
<2en> I opened T@@ wit@@ ter to express myself and post interesting t@@ we@@ ets . 
<2en> " I don 't know if they answer me , I only up@@ load them " he ad@@ ds . 
<2en> " social networ@@ king is f@@ un , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says . 
<2en> he does not hesi@@ tate to reply that he would never accept a request from an un@@ known person . 
<2en> nor would he take any notice of someone who recommen@@ ds a stran@@ ger to him . 
<2en> the case of Jo@@ sep@@ h , aged 14 , is different . 
<2en> this te@@ en@@ ager has accounts with Ho@@ t@@ mail , F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok , M@@ y S@@ pace and As@@ k , and in the last case he ad@@ mits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list . 
<2en> " it do@@ es@@ n 't bo@@ ther me , because we have something in common , like music " he says . 
<2en> the bo@@ y says that no@@ -@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number . 
<2en> " if they pres@@ su@@ red me or asked me for it , I '@@ d just dele@@ te them from my account " he states . 
<2en> Jo@@ sep@@ h became a follow@@ er on As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on T@@ wit@@ ter . 
<2en> this te@@ en@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ ber@@ bu@@ ll@@ ying . 
<2en> an acqu@@ ain@@ tance of a friend of mine was being pes@@ tered on a social network . 
<2en> they were threatening him and demanding money from him . 
<2en> " I never found out who it was " he says . 
<2en> the victim , according to José , did not close his account . 
<2en> " he just made it private . " 
<2en> he then expla@@ ins a series of steps to confi@@ g@@ ure the account sa@@ f@@ ely . 
<2en> unlike J@@ or@@ ge , this bo@@ y would up@@ load pho@@ tos of acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces in un@@ comfor@@ table or embar@@ rass@@ ing situations . 
<2en> I would do it if I di@@ dn 't like som@@ ebo@@ dy , or they made me want to do it . 
<2en> " however , I know that 's cy@@ ber@@ bu@@ ll@@ ying " he ad@@ mits . 
<2en> key questions 
<2en> Mari@@ el@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teach@@ er with a degree in Education and Le@@ ar@@ ning , believes that to guide children and te@@ en@@ agers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform . 
<2en> " the Internet emerged as a means of se@@ arch@@ ing for information , but with the appearance of these web@@ sites , the rules of the game changed " he says . 
<2en> Por@@ ras says the scho@@ lar Mar@@ c P@@ ren@@ sky , with a Ma@@ ster 's degree in Education from Y@@ ale University and author of the work Di@@ gi@@ tal Na@@ tives , Di@@ gi@@ tal Im@@ migrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon . 
<2en> digital na@@ tives are those children and young people born with technology . 
<2en> " we are the digital immigrants who have to te@@ ach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says . 
<2en> he says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to dis@@ close , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which matur@@ ity is not condu@@ ci@@ ve to this . " 
<2en> " they also have to be selec@@ tive when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he ad@@ ds . 
<2en> according to the speci@@ alist , the most effective way to te@@ ach children and te@@ en@@ agers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think . 
<2en> " telling them not to do it is no good " he ad@@ ds . 
<2en> Por@@ ras then lists some options : there are things you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't tell a stran@@ ger , so why do it online ? 
<2en> or , would you like a friend to publish a p@@ hoto of you like the one you pos@@ ted of a friend ? 
<2en> do you know what others publish about you ? 
<2en> when tag@@ ging party pho@@ tos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ? 
<2en> and one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ? 
<2en> another point is to make them see that they must be@@ have online as they do off@@ line . 
<2en> the rules are the same . 
<2en> " outside the Internet , people act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says . 
<2en> monitoring 
<2en> Stu@@ art Gu@@ ard , a university prof@@ essor , primary school teach@@ er and educational consul@@ tant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thoroughly . 
<2en> by understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account . 
<2en> " for example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says . 
<2en> according to Gu@@ ar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the " don 't talk to stran@@ gers " lesson . 
<2en> U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R Summit clo@@ ses without making public the L@@ im@@ a Declaration 
<2en> the Si@@ x@@ th Presiden@@ tial Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( U@@ na@@ sur ) concluded today in Per@@ u without making public the L@@ im@@ a Declaration , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders . 
<2en> E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Si@@ x@@ th U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R Me@@ e@@ ting of Heads of State and Government , but Presiden@@ tial and Chan@@ cell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Government website . 
<2en> when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been dis@@ closed by Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta H@@ um@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press . 
<2en> journalists ' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times . 
<2en> during the summit , in the press room , only video was ai@@ red , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audi@@ o restricted . " 
<2en> the little information that circu@@ lated among repor@@ ters was given by the press spo@@ kes@@ men of some of the U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R governments atten@@ ding the meeting , but not the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Government . 
<2en> the only document released during the summit was the list of atten@@ ding presiden@@ ts , which an@@ ger@@ ed hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details . 
<2en> the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President then sent an ema@@ il to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was H@@ um@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit . 
<2en> last October , Per@@ u hos@@ ted the Th@@ ir@@ d Summit of South Ameri@@ can@@ -@@ Arab Coun@@ tries ( AS@@ PA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced L@@ im@@ a Declaration was again not made public . 
<2en> the AS@@ PA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday . 
<2en> at both international events , the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an authorities were at pa@@ ins to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum . 
<2en> the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Per@@ u to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to ad@@ judi@@ cate a border dispute between the two countries . 
<2en> the Presidents of Per@@ u , Ol@@ lan@@ ta H@@ um@@ ala , and Chile , S@@ eb@@ as@@ ti@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the law@@ suit L@@ im@@ a has fi@@ led against S@@ anti@@ ago . 
<2en> " we will obe@@ y and execu@@ te the order that currently defin@@ es the differences we are bringing before this international court " said H@@ um@@ ala , together with his Chi@@ le@@ an counter@@ part . 
<2en> " Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts " added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , gre@@ e@@ ting H@@ um@@ ala with a hand@@ sha@@ ke , alongside the fla@@ gs of the two countries . 
<2en> confirmation of both presiden@@ ts that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denoun@@ ced the Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the jud@@ gement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime bo@@ un@@ dary with Ni@@ car@@ agua which it regarded as seriously fla@@ wed . 
<2en> the summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez ; Bo@@ li@@ via , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Ar@@ gen@@ tina , Cris@@ tina Kir@@ chn@@ er . 
<2en> Par@@ agu@@ ay , which was suspended by U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R in 2011 after the dis@@ miss@@ al of former President Fern@@ ando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting . 
<2en> host President Ol@@ lan@@ ta H@@ um@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in L@@ im@@ a . 
<2en> the President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments . 
<2en> among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R countries will take " important steps to@@ ward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . " 
<2en> he reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against in@@ security and transnational organised crime , actions to make medi@@ cation more accessible , low@@ -@@ cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . " 
<2en> with Europe in crisis , " economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ist attitude but should serve to expand its productive ma@@ tri@@ x and gli@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people " H@@ um@@ ala added . 
<2en> " we decided to focus on a group of 31 fla@@ g@@ ship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President in a message read out . 
<2en> among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Per@@ u and are located in the trans@@ verse ax@@ es of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with E@@ cu@@ ador , although he gave no further details . 
<2en> also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Par@@ agu@@ ay . 
<2en> " we hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded . 
<2en> the need for Latin America to remain a prosper@@ ous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit . 
<2en> in this sense , the President of Colombia , Ju@@ an Manu@@ el San@@ tos , said before atten@@ ding the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counter@@ part from Ni@@ car@@ agua , D@@ ani@@ el Ortega , on Sat@@ ur@@ day in Mexico , to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , question@@ ed by Bo@@ go@@ ta . 
<2en> " the day after tomorrow ( Sat@@ ur@@ day ) I might have a meeting with President D@@ ani@@ el Ortega " San@@ tos said . 
<2en> " we will review all these pa@@ ths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Ni@@ car@@ agua will require a conver@@ sation with Ni@@ car@@ agua " he emphasised . 
<2en> " with President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilis@@ ed and respec@@ t@@ ful manner possible " said San@@ tos . 
<2en> San@@ tos and Ortega are due to meet on Sat@@ ur@@ day in Mexico , where they expect to attend the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration of the country 's new President , En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ña N@@ ie@@ to . 
<2en> also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region . 
<2en> Ar@@ gen@@ tina , Bo@@ li@@ via , Colombia , E@@ cu@@ ador , Per@@ u , Brazil , U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , S@@ ur@@ in@@ am and Par@@ agu@@ ay make up U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R , although the latter is currently suspended . 
<2en> Per@@ u has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional bloc . 
<2en> " South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Ra@@ fa@@ el Cor@@ rea 
<2en> the President of E@@ cu@@ ador , Ra@@ fa@@ el Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . " 
<2en> Cor@@ rea , who took part in the E@@ lev@@ enth Presiden@@ tial Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R ) held in L@@ im@@ a , told Per@@ u 's state television that Europeans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now practically one country . " 
<2en> to this end , he defen@@ ded the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R . 
<2en> " we have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Community . however , there are still reac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said . 
<2en> the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the pre@@ mise of reducing the influence of the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sa@@ x@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights . 
<2en> those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything . 
<2en> " it is in@@ comprehensible that the Inter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to E@@ cu@@ ador giving political asylum to Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s fo@@ under Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange . 
<2en> Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . " 
<2en> he added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspici@@ on that Ass@@ ange would be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respected . " 
<2en> addi@@ tionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to question@@ ing for an alle@@ ged sexual off@@ ence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dicta@@ tes that he can be question@@ ed via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y in London . " 
<2en> Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterior@@ ation of Ass@@ ange 's physical and mental health . 
<2en> " I have not spoken to him since he was at our emb@@ ass@@ y , but the ambassa@@ dor informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President . 
<2en> what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being lo@@ cked in a small space without any out@@ door exercise . 
<2en> " that would compli@@ cate the health of any person " he added . 
<2en> Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y , in London , through the issue of a safe@@ -@@ conduct pass that per@@ mits travel to E@@ cu@@ ador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprison@@ ment of the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s fo@@ under . 
<2en> we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions . 
<2en> " the solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange 's law@@ yer , Bal@@ ta@@ zar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said . 
<2en> and he felt that " if Britain says no to the safe@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . " 
<2en> and if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ ange at the Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y of E@@ cu@@ ador in London , or interro@@ ga@@ tes him via S@@ ky@@ pe tomorrow , this problem is over . 
<2en> Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not toler@@ ate is " the medi@@ oc@@ rit@@ y , dis@@ hon@@ esty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . " 
<2en> " the greatest enem@@ ies of the press freedom are not evil and wick@@ ed politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and ex@@ tor@@ tion " he said . 
<2en> in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the ban@@ kers or bour@@ geo@@ is and he@@ gem@@ on@@ ic countries that domin@@ ate E@@ cu@@ ador " and said that , if re@@ -@@ elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . " 
<2en> Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Par@@ agu@@ ay in U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R , at least until their next elections , argu@@ ing that the body " must be firm and not toler@@ ate opportun@@ ism and a coup ma@@ sk@@ ed with leg@@ ality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitimacy of Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an democracy . " 
<2en> the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an President also considered the " perfectly pertinent " desire of his Colom@@ bian counter@@ part , Ju@@ an Manu@@ el San@@ tos , to now negotiate with Ni@@ car@@ agua the maritime bo@@ un@@ dary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Ni@@ car@@ agu@@ an maritime sovereignty . 
<2en> for now that ruling is not being followed . 
<2en> it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one . 
<2en> conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together . 
<2en> they need to be proces@@ sed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward . 
<2en> addi@@ tionally , he tr@@ usted in a sound conclusion to the maritime bo@@ un@@ dary dispute oppos@@ ing Per@@ u and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . " 
<2en> with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the up@@ coming presidential elections in E@@ cu@@ ador seeking a third consecu@@ tive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimis@@ m and jo@@ y , although at times it is pre@@ tty hard . " 
<2en> Cor@@ rea said that if he lo@@ ses the elections in February 2013 , he will retire from public life . 
<2en> personally , I 've never been interested in power , but in situations as un@@ just as those in E@@ cu@@ ador , socio@@ -@@ economic poverty can only be correc@@ ted by political power . 
<2en> " my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said . 
<2en> if I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life . 
<2en> if I lose , likewise . 
<2en> " it 's a decision " he confirmed . 
<2en> Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezu@@ el@@ an President Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez 's new health treatment in Cuba . 
<2en> I just spoke with Venezu@@ el@@ an Vice President Ni@@ col@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he t@@ ells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was already planned , rou@@ tine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba . 
<2en> " this does not mean a health rela@@ p@@ se for President Cha@@ vez " he said . 
<2en> in L@@ im@@ a today , the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an He@@ ad of State attended the Si@@ x@@ th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sus@@ tain progress , equality and security . 
<2en> deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late dete@@ ction 
<2en> F@@ abri@@ zio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive . 
<2en> " it was like a bom@@ b dro@@ pped on me " he says , rec@@ alling the time of the announcement , which the doc@@ tor was trying to make " sof@@ ter , " apparently un@@ successfully . 
<2en> the bo@@ y hi@@ d it from his family . 
<2en> he decided to care for his ill@@ ness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celeb@@ ra@@ ted his 4@@ 3@@ r@@ d bir@@ th@@ day . 
<2en> he is undoubtedly one of the ol@@ dest patients in the HIV Un@@ it of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil H@@ os@@ pi@@ tal ( C@@ H@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several bat@@ t@@ les with his health . 
<2en> F@@ abri@@ zio has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 9@@ 0s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of sti@@ g@@ ma . 
<2en> then , even the director of an IM@@ SS [ Mexi@@ can Social Security Institute ] clini@@ c refused to discharge him " because he had a cut . " 
<2en> at that time , having A@@ ids was sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with death . 
<2en> now it is possible to survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life . 
<2en> however , many people are still un@@ aware of their ill@@ ness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused ha@@ vo@@ c , " exhaus@@ ted " their im@@ m@@ une systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infec@@ tions . 
<2en> 31 years after of the on@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the C@@ H@@ G HIV Un@@ it , Ja@@ i@@ me An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous scientific jour@@ nal . 
<2en> infec@@ tious disease speci@@ alist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expec@@ tan@@ cy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the im@@ m@@ une system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , with a higher life expec@@ tan@@ cy for non@@ -@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count . 
<2en> in simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e . 
<2en> to g@@ au@@ ge this progress , it should be remember@@ ed that the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy of Mexi@@ cans today is 76 years . 
<2en> although mortali@@ ty has dro@@ pped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( U@@ NA@@ IDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the ad@@ vent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died . 
<2en> in J@@ alis@@ co alone , only 2@@ 55 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs since 2005 . 
<2en> - W@@ hy are do still deaths occur ? 
<2en> - I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment . 
<2en> that 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital . 
<2en> for at least the last 12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of ill@@ ness because they are un@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease . 
<2en> he gave a comp@@ elling statisti@@ c : " nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportun@@ istic infec@@ tion , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortali@@ ty is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass dete@@ ction tests for everyone who needs them . " 
<2en> speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ vention in J@@ alis@@ co ( CO@@ ES@@ I@@ DA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as F@@ abri@@ zio , who came to be tested at a private labor@@ atory , motiv@@ ated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ pos@@ i s@@ ar@@ com@@ a , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that is one of the common compli@@ cations . 
<2en> everything changes when you know you have AIDS . 
<2en> some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything . 
<2en> " if I 'm going to die , I '@@ d rather have a b@@ low@@ -@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case . 
<2en> the change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs . 
<2en> to date , his parents are only aware he had cancer . 
<2en> I live as normal a life as anyone else . 
<2en> " I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said F@@ abri@@ zio , who agreed to share his inti@@ mate secre@@ ts with M@@ IL@@ EN@@ I@@ O J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid . 
<2en> they should get tested if they are at ris@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible . 
<2en> this is his message , which summar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 . 
<2en> con@@ doms behind the counter . 
<2en> the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ri@@ car@@ do Sala@@ zar , a journ@@ alist from Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause . 
<2en> and the greatest cure is prevention . 
<2en> in places dedicated to this task " the distribution of con@@ doms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pac@@ kets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ doms " he said . 
<2en> among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are te@@ en@@ agers . 
<2en> " why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m and jud@@ ged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , pharma@@ cy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to ex@@ pose te@@ en@@ agers to sex , said the speaker . 
<2en> it was decided to change such in@@ efficient allocation , and that con@@ doms should not only be placed behind coun@@ ters , but that pac@@ kets of one hundred should be found in public to@@ i@@ let dis@@ pen@@ sers in places frequ@@ en@@ ted by young people . 
<2en> this is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity . 
<2en> it is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ tel fe@@ es , as Govern@@ or E@@ mili@@ o Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ doms during his administration . 
<2en> " and it 's not about sexu@@ ality , but it is best to provide con@@ doms to those already prac@@ tising sexual activity " he said . 
<2en> J@@ alis@@ co key points 
<2en> there are 13@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) . 
<2en> the state is 4@@ th in the nation in new and cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cases of AIDS and 13@@ th in HIV . 
<2en> 92 % of new infec@@ tions are through sex , 6 % via the bloo@@ d@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ a@@ tal . 
<2en> an estimated 50@@ ,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4@@ -@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive . 
<2en> ratified by a United States court of appeal , a jud@@ gement which ign@@ ores the restructuring of the V@@ it@@ ro Group 's debt achieved via a bankrup@@ t@@ cy in Mexico , the scenario is an omin@@ ous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solven@@ cy problems . 
<2en> it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexi@@ can law are not valid in the land of st@@ ars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions . 
<2en> in practical terms , the endor@@ sement of the jud@@ gement delivered on 15 June by Ju@@ dge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern Dis@@ tric@@ t of Tex@@ as , leaves Mexi@@ can firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible se@@ iz@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico . 
<2en> however , the decision opens the door for the leading gla@@ ss manufac@@ turer in Mexico to appeal to the Su@@ pre@@ me Court of the United States , claim@@ ing three in@@ consisten@@ cies . 
<2en> from the start , while the trial judge notes that credi@@ tors should be governed by the United States Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Code , the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the Fi@@ f@@ th C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it , based in New Or@@ le@@ ans , states that the main action is the in@@ solven@@ cy action handled in Mexico . 
<2en> the first point would involve ignor@@ ing international procedural cooperation in cases of in@@ solven@@ cy of companies with transnational profi@@ les . 
<2en> indeed , the UN Mo@@ del Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ for@@ mity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute posi@@ tion@@ ed as arbitra@@ tor . 
<2en> secondly , the jud@@ gement establis@@ hes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the deb@@ ts the V@@ it@@ ro subsidi@@ aries had with their par@@ ent company recognised in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved . 
<2en> however , Mexi@@ can law recognises the possibility . 
<2en> in fact , the V@@ it@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted . 
<2en> there are half a do@@ zen examples , including Agre@@ me@@ x and Com@@ mer@@ cial Mexi@@ can@@ a , whose inter@@ company deb@@ ts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Institute . 
<2en> what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidi@@ aries , the V@@ it@@ ro credi@@ tors who fought against it in the US courts , namely " vul@@ ture " funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os C@@ apital , Au@@ reli@@ os Con@@ ver@@ gence , E@@ lli@@ ot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool L@@ im@@ ited , did not achieve a majority . 
<2en> the vote was apparently 45 percent ver@@ sus 37 . 
<2en> this data is om@@ it@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al . 
<2en> from another perspective , the latter bla@@ mes V@@ it@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country . 
<2en> for now , the Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lo@@ dged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously . 
<2en> should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Su@@ pre@@ me Court , will be fi@@ led . 
<2en> the real problem is that the court by@@ passed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of ami@@ cus curi@@ a@@ e ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by V@@ it@@ ro under the framework of the Com@@ mer@@ cial In@@ solven@@ cy Law , no@@ ting that the latter dis@@ charged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with C@@ hap@@ ter 15 of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States . 
<2en> moreover , it should be noted that the country yi@@ el@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross@@ -@@ border in@@ solven@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .

<2en> the proceedings he@@ aded by Car@@ los Di@@ a@@ z Cha@@ vez Mor@@ in@@ eau has just fi@@ led a criminal complaint against the National Ban@@ king and Secur@@ ities Commission , which is accused of ob@@ struc@@ ting justice . 
<2en> the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the At@@ tor@@ ney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 19@@ 8 million pes@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of Banco I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mexi@@ can@@ a de A@@ vi@@ ación .

<2en> as you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Cari@@ b@@ be@@ an , selling Chinese products , with a resi@@ den@@ tial area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies . 
<2en> previously , C@@ AN@@ AC@@ IN@@ TR@@ A had managed to uni@@ te the gover@@ nor@@ s of the sou@@ the@@ ast of Mexico to oppose the monu@@ mental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .

<2en> H@@ ec@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes : " bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life " 
<2en> bas@@ ket@@ ball glo@@ be@@ tro@@ tter H@@ ec@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , trav@@ elled the world . 
<2en> few people in P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ co have a mental rec@@ ol@@ lection of local bas@@ ket@@ ball history as broad as that of H@@ éc@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes . 
<2en> Re@@ yes was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being confin@@ ed to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 following a stro@@ ke ; he was a minor lea@@ gue player , National Su@@ peri@@ or Bas@@ ket@@ ball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and man@@ ager with the B@@ ay@@ am@@ ón Va@@ quer@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ket@@ ball Federation . 
<2en> " I wor@@ e lo@@ ts of ha@@ ts in bas@@ ket@@ ball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general man@@ ager and feder@@ ative president of the National Te@@ am during the ' 9@@ 0s , " rec@@ alled Re@@ yes during Pri@@ mera H@@ ora 's visit to his home in B@@ ay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with I@@ sa@@ bel , his loy@@ al wi@@ fe for over 50 years . 
<2en> " bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life . " 
<2en> Re@@ yes is not exag@@ ger@@ ating when he makes that statement . 
<2en> the w@@ alls of his house are almost totally de@@ cor@@ ated with pic@@ tures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long career , which goes to prove it . 
<2en> B@@ ay@@ am@@ ón at heart 
<2en> of them all , the ones he tre@@ as@@ ures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the Va@@ quer@@ os , from the mid@@ -@@ 5@@ 0s as a player until 198@@ 2 , when he completed 15 years ser@@ ving as co@@ -@@ ag@@ ent or ag@@ ent of the franch@@ ise . 
<2en> " those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the Va@@ quer@@ os ' eight cham@@ pion@@ ships , since 196@@ 7 , either as ag@@ ent , co@@ -@@ ag@@ ent or man@@ ager . 
<2en> there were many good years , including the five consecu@@ tive cham@@ pion@@ ships from 197@@ 1 to 19@@ 75 . 
<2en> and then I said good@@ by@@ e with one in 198@@ 1 , Jer@@ om@@ e Min@@ cy 's de@@ but year in the B@@ S@@ N . 
<2en> then " Cu@@ co " Or@@ ti@@ z took over - he was a great man@@ ager " said Re@@ yes . 
<2en> I remember that G@@ ene Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of A@@ lab@@ ama ( Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " t@@ all . 
<2en> do you want him ? ' 
<2en> and that was the beginning of Min@@ cy , one of the best players P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ co ever had . 
<2en> Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the shar@@ p@@ sho@@ o@@ ter G@@ aus@@ se R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d , who established resi@@ den@@ cy here and was one of our best sho@@ o@@ ters . 
<2en> I remember him saying that if Min@@ cy had given B@@ ay@@ am@@ on one cham@@ pion@@ ship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another . 
<2en> the Va@@ quer@@ os ' cham@@ pion@@ ship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ sho@@ t . 
<2en> for that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and Min@@ cy 's accompl@@ is@@ h@@ ments in the national team . 
<2en> I remember when we be@@ at the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre@@ -@@ Olympi@@ cs in Mexico . 
<2en> then came the 1990 World C@@ up , where we came fourth and it should have been b@@ ron@@ ze , but for the Can@@ adi@@ an refer@@ e@@ e who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Re@@ yes . 
<2en> is the 1990 World National Te@@ am the best you 've ever seen ? 
<2en> it 's one of the best , as good as the one that be@@ at the D@@ re@@ am Te@@ am in the 2004 Olympi@@ cs . 
<2en> however , my favou@@ rite was the one in the 1991 P@@ an American G@@ ames in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a be@@ ating , which was quite similar to the time we won b@@ ron@@ ze at the World C@@ up . 
<2en> that team not only again included Min@@ cy , G@@ aus@@ se , R@@ am@@ on Ri@@ vas , Fi@@ co L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and ' Pi@@ cul@@ ín ' ( Or@@ ti@@ z ) , but also the young ( Ja@@ vier ) ' To@@ ñ@@ i@@ to ' Col@@ ón and J@@ ames Car@@ ter , the Le@@ on bro@@ thers ( Fran@@ cis@@ co and E@@ d@@ gar ) and M@@ ario ' Qui@@ jo@@ te ' Mor@@ ales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a k@@ ne@@ e injur@@ y . 
<2en> a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold me@@ dal and was a great jo@@ y to work with , was the 1995 Pre@@ -@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ quen , Ar@@ gen@@ tina . 
<2en> with role players such as ' C@@ ani@@ to ' Ni@@ eves , P@@ ab@@ lo Ali@@ ce@@ a and the young Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ iner re@@ placing the players suspended after the sha@@ m@@ bles of the Mar del Pla@@ ta Pan@@ -@@ American G@@ ames , we won gold against all the od@@ ds . 
<2en> who was the best P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ can player ? 
<2en> without any doubt , Pi@@ cul@@ ín Or@@ ti@@ z . 
<2en> his numbers at international tour@@ na@@ ment level are a@@ wes@@ om@@ e . 
<2en> nobody in P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ co has domin@@ ated at that level like Pi@@ cul@@ ín did . 
<2en> not to mention his career in the various lea@@ gues he played in . 
<2en> who was the best P@@ uer@@ to Ri@@ can man@@ ager ? 
<2en> that 's a difficult one . 
<2en> we had a very good team , including Ju@@ lio Tor@@ o , F@@ l@@ or Mel@@ en@@ dez , Car@@ los Mor@@ ales , R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Tor@@ res . 
<2en> of the yo@@ ung@@ sters , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll . 
<2en> what do you consider your greatest achievement in the feder@@ ation ? 
<2en> having been part of the National Te@@ am 's most gl@@ ori@@ ous era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 9@@ 0s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a seas@@ on . 
<2en> what was there left for you to do ? 
<2en> there were things I '@@ d have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor lea@@ gues . 
<2en> for example , the bo@@ ys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national pla@@ y@@ off@@ s . 
<2en> right now the ki@@ ds are ri@@ ding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily . 
<2en> at least I see the fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ e@@ es . 
<2en> that ple@@ ases me . 
<2en> what are you doing now ? 
<2en> the most I do is listen to music , watch music vide@@ os from my era on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , enjoy my gran@@ d@@ children and occasion@@ ally go to bas@@ ket@@ ball games . 
<2en> and of course , enjoy the company of my wi@@ fe , E@@ liz@@ abe@@ th , who has always been with me . 
<2en> ac@@ tor L@@ ar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man dies 
<2en> L@@ ar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , born on 21 September 19@@ 31 in For@@ t Wor@@ th ( Tex@@ as ) , became world famous for his role as John Ro@@ ss E@@ wing , better known as " J@@ R , " in the television series " Dal@@ las , " in which he played a ru@@ th@@ less , ma@@ lici@@ ous and manipu@@ la@@ tive busin@@ ess@@ man . 
<2en> L@@ ar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role as oil ty@@ co@@ on pre@@ da@@ tor J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series " Dal@@ las " became a symbol of gre@@ ed in the 198@@ 0s , has died . 
<2en> he was 81 . 
<2en> H@@ ag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new seas@@ on of " Dal@@ las , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer compli@@ cations , according to a family statement provided to the Associ@@ ated Pres@@ s by the War@@ ner Bro@@ s@@ . , producer of " Dal@@ las . " 
<2en> " L@@ ar@@ ry was back in his bel@@ ov@@ ed hom@@ e@@ town of Dal@@ las , once again representing the i@@ con@@ ic role he most liked " the family said . 
<2en> L@@ ar@@ ry 's family and clo@@ s@@ est friends were with him in Dal@@ las for the Than@@ ks@@ giving Day holi@@ day . 
<2en> Lin@@ da Gra@@ y , who played his wi@@ fe in the original series and the se@@ quel , was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dal@@ las , said her public@@ ist , J@@ eff@@ rey Lan@@ e . 
<2en> he brought jo@@ y to all who knew him . 
<2en> he was creative , generous , fun@@ ny , lo@@ ving and tal@@ en@@ ted , and I will miss him de@@ ar@@ ly . 
<2en> " he was an original gu@@ y and lived life to the full " said Gra@@ y in a statement . 
<2en> H@@ ag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and ad@@ mitted that he had dr@@ un@@ k a lot over the years . 
<2en> in 1995 a ma@@ lign@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he under@@ went a trans@@ plant . 
<2en> years before " Dal@@ las , " H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent gu@@ y in the light com@@ edy " I D@@ re@@ am of Je@@ anni@@ e , " ai@@ red on N@@ BC from 19@@ 65 to 19@@ 70 . 
<2en> he played Cap@@ tain Tony N@@ elson , an as@@ tron@@ aut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Bar@@ bar@@ a E@@ den , and takes her home to live with him . 
<2en> he also star@@ red in two si@@ t@@ com@@ s that were not ai@@ red for long , " The Go@@ od Li@@ fe " ( N@@ BC , 197@@ 1@@ -@@ 72 ) and " H@@ ere We G@@ o A@@ gain " ( A@@ BC , 197@@ 3 ) . 
<2en> his film work included ro@@ les well received by cri@@ tics in " The Group , " " Har@@ ry and T@@ onto " and " Pri@@ mar@@ y Col@@ ors . " 
<2en> but it was his ma@@ ster@@ ful interpretation of deli@@ ght@@ fully det@@ estable J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man reaching his pe@@ ak of star@@ dom . 
<2en> the dra@@ ma series on C@@ B@@ S about the E@@ wing cla@@ n and other charac@@ ters in their or@@ bit ai@@ red from April 197@@ 8 to May 1991 . 
<2en> the tag@@ line " W@@ ho sho@@ t J@@ R ? , " designed to generate hy@@ pe around an ep@@ is@@ ode full of emo@@ tions in which H@@ ag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of ris@@ ky dollars w@@ ag@@ ered in g@@ aming establis@@ h@@ ments . 
<2en> it also helped give the series a record audi@@ ence at the time . 
<2en> when the answer was revealed in an ep@@ is@@ ode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million vie@@ wers tun@@ ed in and made " Dal@@ las " the second most wat@@ ched enter@@ tain@@ ment programme in history , after the final ep@@ is@@ ode of " M@@ AS@@ H " in 198@@ 3 , which had 50 million vie@@ wers . 
<2en> it was J@@ R 's sis@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law Kris@@ tin ( played by M@@ ary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who sho@@ t him . 
<2en> J@@ r got her pre@@ gnant then threatened to say she was a prostitu@@ te unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him . 
<2en> H@@ ag@@ man por@@ tra@@ yed E@@ wing as a corrup@@ t in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able man with a char@@ is@@ matic s@@ mi@@ le : a dis@@ honest entrepren@@ eur and che@@ ating hus@@ band who tried to have his alco@@ ho@@ lic wi@@ fe , S@@ ue E@@ llen ( Lin@@ da Gra@@ y ) , sec@@ tion@@ ed . 
<2en> " I know what I want on J@@ R 's tom@@ bst@@ one " H@@ ag@@ man said in 1988 . 
<2en> it should read : " here lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ wing . " 
<2en> this is the only deal he lost . 
<2en> Vi@@ c@@ toria Pr@@ inci@@ p@@ al , co@@ -@@ star of the original series , rec@@ alled H@@ ag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . " 
<2en> he is un@@ for@@ ge@@ t@@ table and irre@@ pla@@ ce@@ able , for millions of f@@ ans around the world , and in the hear@@ ts of each one of us who was fortun@@ ate enough to know and love him . 
<2en> ten ep@@ iso@@ des of the new edi@@ tion of " Dal@@ las " were broad@@ cast a few months ago with great success for T@@ N@@ T . 
<2en> he had already finished rec@@ ord@@ ing five ep@@ iso@@ des for the second series and a six@@ th was in process , the chain reported . 
<2en> immediately after , there was no statement from War@@ ner or T@@ N@@ T about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man . 
<2en> H@@ ag@@ man , born in For@@ t Wor@@ th , Tex@@ as , was the son of ac@@ tress and sin@@ ger M@@ ary Martin , who star@@ red in classi@@ cs such as " South Pacifi@@ c " and " Peter P@@ an . " 
<2en> Martin was still a te@@ en@@ ager when she had him in 19@@ 31 during her mar@@ ri@@ age to law@@ yer B@@ en H@@ ag@@ man . 
<2en> he tried his lu@@ ck in the New York the@@ a@@ tre scene in the early ' 5@@ 0s , and later served in the Air For@@ ce from 195@@ 2 to 195@@ 6 , in England . 
<2en> while there , he met the young Swedish de@@ signer Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ el@@ sson and mar@@ ried her . 
<2en> the couple had two sons , Pres@@ ton and Hei@@ di , and lived for a long time in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ an city M@@ ali@@ bu , home to many celeb@@ ri@@ ties . 
<2en> in 2001 , he called his mem@@ o@@ irs " H@@ ello Dar@@ lin ' : t@@ all ( and Ab@@ solu@@ tely T@@ ru@@ e ) T@@ ales Ab@@ out M@@ y Li@@ fe . " 
<2en> " I di@@ dn 't put anything in it that I believed would hur@@ t anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associ@@ ated Pres@@ s at the time . 
<2en> after his li@@ ver trans@@ plant , he became an organ don@@ ation promo@@ ter and worked as a volun@@ te@@ er at a hospital , helping fe@@ ar@@ ful patients . 
<2en> " I ad@@ vise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their sur@@ ger@@ y , and after@@ wards " he said in 1996 . 
<2en> I try to offer some com@@ fort , such as " D@@ on 't be afraid , it will be a little un@@ comfor@@ table for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . " 
<2en> he was also an anti@@ -@@ smoking activ@@ ist and took part in several campaigns . 
<2en> start of a course that ex@@ pl@@ ores the " En@@ d of the World " 
<2en> each week , students explor@@ e apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic them@@ es such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , vir@@ uses and ger@@ ms , and global warming . 
<2en> this term , when Professor of religion , Stu@@ art char@@ mé , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a comp@@ elling ho@@ ok : the end of the " long coun@@ t@@ down " of the Ma@@ yan cal@@ en@@ dar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming . 
<2en> but char@@ mé had no idea what a@@ wa@@ ited him over the next couple of months : the ca@@ ta@@ cl@@ ys@@ mic hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e San@@ dy , a fiscal preci@@ pi@@ ce some called " debt Ar@@ ma@@ ge@@ d@@ don " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ world Christians the@@ oris@@ ts think the A@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ se will begin . 
<2en> " I di@@ dn 't realise this was going to be the most apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic term ever " said char@@ mé this week to students at Ru@@ t@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den University ( New J@@ erse@@ y ) . 
<2en> if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and coun@@ ting , this has been a really good period . 
<2en> and remember that bad is good for those with an apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic menta@@ lity . 
<2en> and he is not the only prof@@ essor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theore@@ tically the last in history . 
<2en> at Temp@@ le , Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry V@@ ac@@ ker is giving the course " Media , Culture and the end of the world . " 
<2en> each week , students explor@@ e apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic them@@ es such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , vir@@ uses and ger@@ ms , and global warming . 
<2en> " we looked at why these ideas prolifer@@ ate over time " he said , and how they offer hypo@@ the@@ tical scen@@ arios that guide human behaviour . 
<2en> if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out . 
<2en> this month students analy@@ sed movi@@ es with an apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic theme and explor@@ ed how they compare with re@@ al@@ -@@ life examples . 
<2en> " I 've tried to inform students about what is possible , probable , credible and impossible " said V@@ ac@@ ker . 
<2en> at the main P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia State University ca@@ m@@ pus , Latin American His@@ tory Professor Mat@@ the@@ w R@@ est@@ all , and his colleague A@@ mara Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Art His@@ tory and An@@ thro@@ polo@@ gy Professor , have te@@ am@@ ed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . " 
<2en> " we don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world do@@ es@@ n 't come to an end " said R@@ est@@ all . 
<2en> despite the " im@@ pending do@@ om , " students have to study , undertake projects and take final exam@@ s . 
<2en> at Pen@@ n State , the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the A@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said R@@ est@@ all . 
<2en> the courses proved quite popular . 
<2en> " it was fully bo@@ oked within two hours " said R@@ est@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students . 
<2en> we received ema@@ ils for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places . 
<2en> students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around . 
<2en> " I find it fas@@ cin@@ ating to see what people do to con@@ sole themselves " said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ in@@ son , a 2@@ 3@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ gradu@@ ate Religion and Soci@@ ology stu@@ dent from H@@ ad@@ don@@ field , New J@@ erse@@ y , at Ru@@ t@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den . 
<2en> and the apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic , secu@@ lar or religious menta@@ lity is just a matter con@@ so@@ lation or a lack of it . 
<2en> will We@@ k@@ esa , a 25@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ gradu@@ ate P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology and N@@ urs@@ ing stu@@ dent , said he had seen all the apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic movi@@ es . 
<2en> " I '@@ d never heard of a class that could te@@ ach it " he said . 
<2en> I enjoy it . 
<2en> but none of the students inter@@ viewed - much less any prof@@ essor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st . 
<2en> " our first project was about the Ma@@ yan prop@@ he@@ cy and to a certain extent we dis@@ credi@@ ted it " said Ju@@ lie Ze@@ g@@ len , a 21@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old final year stu@@ dent at Temp@@ le , from West Ch@@ ester . 
<2en> the May@@ ans never predic@@ ted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the cal@@ en@@ dar , said R@@ est@@ all . 
<2en> but he said that Western culture suff@@ ers from apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world . 
<2en> the Internet has caused a bo@@ om in these specu@@ lations . 
<2en> " in other places , people don 't think about it " he said . 
<2en> it 's mostly in the Englis@@ h@@ -@@ speaking world . 
<2en> Jo@@ sep@@ h D@@ ou@@ gh@@ er@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University , who is giving courses in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there . 
<2en> " the Phili@@ pp@@ ines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , sug@@ gest@@ ing an exception of a higher authority . 
<2en> we have an indul@@ gence from the P@@ ope . 
<2en> R@@ est@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last jud@@ gement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or philosop@@ his@@ ing that December 21st is the beginning of a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year period after which the world will end . 
<2en> students and teachers are taking the date li@@ ghtly . 
<2en> some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties . 
<2en> " maybe I 'll call some friends so we can have a lau@@ gh together " said Sa@@ mi@@ ra Ford , 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old communications stu@@ dent .
