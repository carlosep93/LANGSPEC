a Republican strategy to counter the re@@ -@@ election of Obama 
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud . 
however , the Bren@@ nan Centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is ra@@ rer in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ t@@ ning . 
indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade . 
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn@@ -@@ out . 
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system . 
unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States . 
it is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult . 
this phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republican representatives added in 26 States . 
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone . 
the new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship . 
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record . 
before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card . 
In@@ di@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement . 
in 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the In@@ di@@ ana law . 
the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States . 
over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card . 
it is important to note that , unlike Que@@ be@@ c , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card . 
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State . 
in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification . 
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card . 
the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes . 
in fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card . 
and that 's not all . 
students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution . 
on the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote . 
prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote . 
Ari@@ z@@ ona was the first to introduce such a requirement . 
since 2011 , a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens . 
these measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ panic vote . 
however , it appears that two out of three His@@ panic voters favour the Democratic party . 
what is more , in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States . 
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register . 
these restrictions are not without consequence . 
for example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens . 
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 . 
in addition , Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period . 
for example , during the 2008 general election in Flori@@ da , 33 % of early voters were Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State . 
the same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics . 
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early . 
on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters . 
of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration . 
several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors . 
the United States At@@ torney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws . 
they were able to partially limit the damage . 
for example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card . 
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 . 
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States . 
a 2011 Bren@@ nan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency . 
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections . 
but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn@@ -@@ out . 
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system . 
pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ? 
indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions . 
enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests . 
take the test or not ? 
we asked two specialists for their opinion . 
in studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations . 
another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not . 
this study also showed , with a follow@@ -@@ up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for meta@@ st@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening . 
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer . 
Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk . 
the key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected . 
there are aggressive cancers and others that are in@@ dol@@ ent . 
the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state cancers that are not long@@ -@@ term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease . 
today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening . 
active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will be offered treatment . 
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated . 
therefore I recommend taking the test . 
but the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it . 
in collaboration with the Soci@@ é@@ t@@ é internation@@ ale d '@@ U@@ ro@@ logi@@ e [ S@@ I@@ U ] , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the P@@ SA test . 
you can download the document ( in English for the time being , a [ French ] translation will be available shortly ) at this address : h@@ tt@@ p : / / ca@@ .@@ mo@@ v@@ ember@@ .@@ com / f@@ r / men@@ s@@ -@@ health / pro@@ state@@ -@@ canc@@ er@@ -@@ screening 
preventing the disease 
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer . 
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it . 
it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented . 
" if no more people smoked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says André Beau@@ li@@ eu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society . 
on the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are hereditary . 
some are also completely unexplained . 
for the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers . 
cigarettes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases . 
it is also a risk factor for a number of others . 
this massively damages people 's health . 
" even today , there are 1.5 million smokers in Que@@ be@@ c " deplores spokesperson André Beau@@ li@@ eu . 
encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half . 
weight 
overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease , according to the S@@ CC . 
they can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tu@@ m , o@@ es@@ op@@ hagus , pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us . 
" research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer " it is also said . 
diet 
the organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat . 
in large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal cancer . 
likewise , so do cured meat products , and these should be avoided . 
the conservation of meat by smoking , drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens . 
" they can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained . 
vitamins 
in recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer . 
for the time being however their research is in@@ conclusive . 
studies on vitamin E are contradictory , according to the S@@ CC . 
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase . 
also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear . 
in addition , Mr Beau@@ li@@ eu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor . 
" taking a screening test doesn 't give you cancer . " 
the Hi@@ gg@@ s bo@@ son revealed 
the announcement of the probable discovery of the Hi@@ gg@@ s bo@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason . 
indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ verse , no less . 
also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Stand@@ ard Model - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empir@@ ically . 
but for physi@@ c@@ ists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hi@@ gg@@ s . 
we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle , and greatly resembles the Hi@@ gg@@ s bo@@ son predicted by the Stand@@ ard Model . 
in addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure . 
but let 's suppose that it really is the Hi@@ gg@@ s , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is . 
in our world , there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time . 
there 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go mad . 
however , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Paul@@ i exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same " quantum state " - this " state " consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics . 
based on this , physi@@ c@@ ists classify particles into two categories . 
in one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ m@@ ions , who wisely obey the Paul@@ i principle . 
while lurking in the other are the bo@@ sons , a nasty band of anarch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time . 
these bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : m@@ es@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and " force particles " by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the Hi@@ gg@@ s bo@@ son may be somehow related . 
these bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bu@@ gs as you might think . 
in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the pho@@ ton , or the " light particle " which is the " messenger " of the electromagnetic force . 
when , in fact , a particle having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this " disturbs " the electromagnetic field in this specific place , rather like a pe@@ bble thrown in a pond . 
this " disturbance " produces an electromagnetic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a pho@@ ton - and thus one of the " force carrier " bo@@ sons . 
more stable field 
the same applies to the Hi@@ gg@@ s bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hi@@ gg@@ s field , which must be " disturbed " for the bo@@ son to appear . 
now , this Hi@@ gg@@ s field is much , much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wr@@ ink@@ le the surface . 
which is why a huge particle acceler@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels . 
the analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Hi@@ gg@@ s and mass . 
in fact not all particles , or all materials , interact with the electromagnetic field . 
some , such as mag@@ nets , do so , but others don 't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fri@@ dge . 
and likewise , not all particles interact with the Hi@@ gg@@ s field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the pho@@ ton ) do not . 
now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ on@@ don . 
for science , it serves to check the validity of the Stand@@ ard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM . 
a number of people , moreover , fervently hope that some will be found , because the slightest difference could open a door to a " new physics " and plug certain holes in the Model . 
this , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Uni@@ verse ( re@@ -@@ o@@ ops ! ) . 
but to date no such discrepancies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N . 
repercussions 
the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won 't be any . 
remember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pioneers of the las@@ er at Bel@@ l L@@ abor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work . 
they had an ink@@ ling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest . 
in fact , the late Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at Bel@@ l Lab@@ s , where the las@@ er was invented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous las@@ er ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the las@@ er was rather seen as a " la@@ b gad@@ get . " 
just imagine ... 
and then , applications can also come from all the instrum@@ entation that surrounds research . 
for example , the same Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle developed a small light sen@@ sor in 196@@ 9 , during his work in op@@ tics . 
this sen@@ sor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009 . 
this does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ... 
palliative care - The best way to die ... Le Dev@@ o@@ ir 
with its D@@ ying with Di@@ gn@@ ity Commission , Que@@ be@@ c recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life . 
the debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared . 
however , in this vital area , much remains to be done . 
Le Dev@@ o@@ ir attempted to look more closely . 
just a few weeks ago Mr L@@ . lived alone in his Mont@@ ér@@ é@@ gi@@ e apar@@ tment . 
the fe@@ stering pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two@@ -@@ year respite . 
" they gave me five years to live , I '@@ ve made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is palliative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day . 
" but it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it " he adds . 
the disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toil@@ et alone , and even eating alone . 
sitting in front of an appe@@ tising lunch , he cons@@ ents to being helped to eat , resigned . 
courageous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bu@@ st@@ ling around him , bringing him his medication , offering him a bath . 
the courage of ordinary death . 
" what I want most is to be cured of my di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea , it 's humiliating " he confi@@ ded . 
a few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness . 
" during our lives , we learn that a man p@@ is@@ ses standing up , " says Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psycho@@ logist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home . 
reg@@ ressing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation . 
" it depends on the person 's ability " to accept the regression , he says . 
because , in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regression . 
patients at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is palliative care home all suffer from cancer . 
they have a maximum life expectancy of three months . 
at this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so@@ -@@ called " cur@@ ative " care . 
for Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " conscious and suffocating . " 
but the disease has made me discover my children . 
" I have fine children " she adds . 
" I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe . 
she looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy . 
at Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volunteers provides bo@@ dily care and help with feeding . 
this is palliative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done . 
to make death more comfortable . 
in Que@@ be@@ c , there are palliative care beds for 11@@ ,@@ 700 inhabitants . 
this is very few when we know that we will all die one day . 
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home . 
whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level . 
a person who is dying will accept being helped to drink bran@@ dy or P@@ ep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ p@@ ple . 
diabe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar . 
and death is part of everyday life . 
yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night . 
this morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased . 
" we help relatives as much as patients " says N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of C@@ are . 
at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike . 
along with a 9@@ 3@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old man who is sav@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly w@@ edged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ asts are drunk in his honour , a 36@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ young man is dying tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive . 
" for six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel . 
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital . 
lack of access to palliative care 
it is said that 77 % of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home . 
and a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients . 
it is precisely this large gap in Que@@ be@@ c health care which has made a number of palliative care physi@@ cians fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide . 
since October , a manifesto , signed by palliative care lum@@ in@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bernard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative . 
according to Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Que@@ be@@ c health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia . 
recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering . 
I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care . 
and at the same time , some on@@ co@@ logists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst prog@@ noses . 
Hélène Richard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y . 
when I announced to my on@@ co@@ logist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting , she said . 
however , she had told me I was finished ! 
no all@@ -@@ powerful care 
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team . 
but it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all@@ -@@ powerful in the treatment of pain . 
according to El@@ si@@ e Mone@@ reau , Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases . 
at the very end of life , physi@@ cians then often resort to palliative sed@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ ad@@ ically or permanently . 
we can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering . 
increasingly , an un@@ relieved patient will have the option of having such palliative sed@@ ation . 
patients who are not relieved always say the same thing : " I want to die . " 
but this does not necessarily mean " I want you to euthan@@ ise me , " it means " I want to be relieved . " 
this report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes . 
widespread real estate scandals in Que@@ be@@ c 
day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund@@ -@@ rais@@ ers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable " system , " combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade unionists and organised crime . 
an " industry " which has cost Que@@ be@@ c taxpayers dearly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s . 
" it is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures " says Jacques Duc@@ hes@@ ne@@ au ironically , a Que@@ be@@ c politician and former Montreal Chief of Police . 
it was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in@@ -@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Que@@ be@@ c , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had consented only reluctantly . 
the " Duc@@ hes@@ ne@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , under@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ table financing of parties and bribery of officials . 
" since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share ! 
the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission " has already brought down two mayors " he adds , hoping that it will succeed in " revealing the schemes behind the individuals . " 
a permanent anti@@ -@@ corruption unit , created in 2011 
the Permanent An@@ ti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors . 
plus the " Mar@@ teau squ@@ ad " policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal " se@@ wer cartel " to soft ped@@ al on the inflation of contracts ... 
in recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Fran@@ k Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ cot@@ te , Mayor of a suburban town . 
next on the list is apparently Gil@@ les V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval , third largest city in Que@@ be@@ c . 
he is suspected of poc@@ keting repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts . 
others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ cur@@ so and L@@ ino Z@@ ambi@@ to . 
the latter caused a sen@@ sation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts " system " to the commission . 
he himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ ér@@ ald T@@ rem@@ bl@@ ay 's party . 
Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 6@@ 8@@ ,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liberals then in power . 
he also admitted having organised an illegal fund@@ rais@@ er for former Liberal Depu@@ ty@@ -@@ Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ dea@@ u . 
se@@ wer contracts with inflated costs 
in Montreal , the corruption " system " ran smoothly . 
Gil@@ les Sur@@ p@@ ren@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tour@@ nam@@ ents , restaurants , h@@ oc@@ key matches and bribes totalling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he inflated the costs . 
other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms g@@ reas@@ ed by inf@@ lating invoices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add@@ -@@ ons . 
then an organis@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin Dum@@ on@@ t , accused Mr T@@ rem@@ bl@@ ay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money . 
following these revelations , Mr T@@ rem@@ bl@@ ay resigned in early November , plunging Montreal into a major crisis . 
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ lea@@ u was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm . 
mayor of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re@@ -@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom . 
70 % dirty money in election campaigns 
on the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gang@@ rene and catch the culprits . " 
the process , she says , is " painful but positive . " 
the wound is being cleaned , but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices . 
how to clean house . 
properly . 
Jacques Duc@@ hes@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that " officials sto@@ le hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially concerned about the role of " elected people aware of the scheme , " when they were not up to their necks in the scam ! 
estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Que@@ be@@ c at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality . " 
the Que@@ be@@ c government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . " 
he advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : " we can 't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . " 
although this story tarn@@ ishes the international image of Que@@ be@@ c and Montreal , Mr Duc@@ hes@@ ne@@ au invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ... 
" PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! " 
this season , you have taken on a new stature with PS@@ G . 
how do you explain this progression ? 
it can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PS@@ G . 
some great players have arrived . 
every day I 'm making progress alongside them . 
the technical staff has also brought me a lot . 
day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play . 
and , in a match , it 's easier . 
everything moves very fast in football . 
but I don 't get worked up . 
from my de@@ but at the Cl@@ ai@@ ref@@ on@@ taine IN@@ F pre@@ -@@ training centre to my transfer to Sain@@ t@@ -@@ E@@ ti@@ enne , I '@@ ve always moved step by step . 
so you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti ... 
this summer 's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level . 
they also know that every training session is crucial . 
which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best . 
on the other hand , Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti gives me a lot as regards my position . 
he 's supported by deputies like Claude M@@ ak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me . 
is An@@ cel@@ otti the man for the job ? 
definitely . 
An@@ cel@@ otti inspires respect among all the experts . 
today he has no equal in Li@@ gue 1 , and he 's one of the best coaches in Europe . 
he has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs . 
he 's worked with great players . 
I think he will bring more titles to Paris . 
in January , I had an encouraging discussion with him . 
I was just coming back from a series of injuries . 
the confidence he gives me also explains my performance . 
what importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ? 
in Li@@ gue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top . 
but we 're waiting on the sidelines . 
one of our main goals is the Champ@@ ions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way . 
what is the club 's goal in this competition ? 
we 'll try to go as far as possible . 
from now on , anything can happen . 
but we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams . 
first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match . 
can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ? 
it already has the budget ... 
to become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time . 
today , this isn 't the case . 
financially , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen . 
in Li@@ gue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ? 
definitely , it would be a major disappointment . 
this year , we 're really committed to winning the championship . 
we we@@ ren 't far away last season . 
in May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first . 
it was a terrific season . 
we finished with 79 points . 
normally , 79 points is good enough to be top ... 
but another team , Mont@@ pel@@ lier , had an even more fantastic season . 
I think this is the year . 
even if big teams like Marse@@ ille , Lyon and Bor@@ de@@ aux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win . 
do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ? 
it 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have . 
we totally accept it . 
after we won 4@@ -@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating . 
you wonder what more people expect . 
you 're never going to win 4@@ -@@ 0 every weekend . 
we 're not FC Barcelona ! 
we 're trying to implement a game project . 
it takes time to build a team . 
the Champ@@ ions League proved we could hold our own . 
look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts ! 
based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break ! 
that would be to ignore our opponents and the French Champion@@ ship . 
Lyon and Marse@@ ille , who were no good last season , were " boosted " by the new PS@@ G . 
this shows that Li@@ gue 1 is exciting . 
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it . 
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the exploits of Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ o@@ vic . 
so much so that people say there is a " Z@@ lat@@ an dependence . " 
this means Ibra@@ him@@ o@@ vic is very successful and scores a lot of goals . 
that 's why he came , and he 's proving he 's the star of Li@@ gue 1 . 
he 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star . 
within the group , we respect the man and the player . 
and also he respects the men he has around him . 
what he has done is truly exceptional . 
it pushes others to raise their level of play . 
Thi@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also helps everyone else progress . 
how did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ? 
a disappointment . 
I really wanted to play in this Euro . 
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time . 
I saw some things there and came out stronger . 
today , I 'm playing well in selection matches . 
which is what I '@@ ve been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the B@@ lu@@ es . 
I '@@ ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour . 
what do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cham@@ ps 's first few months in charge of the B@@ lu@@ es ? 
he has the results he wanted . 
we 're well placed in the World qualifying group . 
the coach is tough , close to the players , and inspires them to win . 
like Laurent Blanc was . 
but I don 't want to make any comparisons . 
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro . 
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cham@@ ps will take the B@@ lu@@ es to Brazil . 
did the good draw ( 1@@ -@@ 1 ) snat@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ? 
that match gave us confidence . 
everybody fought for everybody . 
before that shock in Spain , I '@@ d never experienced such a match in my career . 
with B@@ it@@ coin , pay and sell without banks 
the opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved . 
in addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is palpable : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises . 
in fact , B@@ it@@ coin , invented by S@@ at@@ osh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to ( a pse@@ ud@@ on@@ ym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but conver@@ tible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like B@@ it@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ peer file exchange . 
around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 computers on the network . 
close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment . 
the bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .@@ com site ) . 
nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products . 
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October . 
it describes bit@@ coin as " the most successful virtual currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to conventional currencies . " 
B@@ it@@ coin differs from other types of virtual currency such as ' credits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) . 
the social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system . 
but , on each occasion , a central authority controls and handles the exchanges . 
with B@@ it@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both custo@@ dians of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issuers , and buyers and sellers . 
how does the network operate ? 
each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e@@ -@@ mail . 
except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity . 
a set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a du@@ al@@ -@@ key encryption system . 
so the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction . 
using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network . 
the key step is entering the new transaction in the book . 
it passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line . 
this is a file ha@@ sh@@ ing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print . 
computers " take " the new transaction and add a number to it , then " ha@@ sh " it all up . 
the goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) . 
once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one . 
the transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ tibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print . 
if a user wanted to defra@@ ud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different im@@ prints . 
the computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins . 
to avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 . 
the number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred million@@ th , which leaves some margin ... 
the difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in compu@@ ting power . 
the life of the network has had its ups and downs . 
websites providing services for B@@ it@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stolen . 
" the loophole used is not the protocol itself " says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at reas@@ sur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the B@@ it@@ coin network . 
the ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service . 
but cash also has this weakness . 
major players like Wiki@@ pe@@ dia refuse donations of this nature . 
others , such as the W@@ ord@@ Press blo@@ g platform , accept them . 
recently , A@@ di S@@ ham@@ ir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circulate . 
in November , " huge sel@@ l@@ -@@ offs " were launched . 
" thirty thousand dollars were exchanged " welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold . 
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network . 
his system , Pay@@ tun@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ ac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses B@@ it@@ coin to validate transactions , which are thus cheaper . 
also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous . 
the system is easy to implement by merchants , who do not need to install new terminals or software . 
they just need to provide an address that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users . 
there is a general movement to re@@ appraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems . 
" it will take time for B@@ it@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , " he predicts . 
the ECB , in its report , says it will reassess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success . 
we got out of Afghanistan . 
what now ? 
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ ap@@ isa and S@@ uro@@ bi ) . 
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 . 
it is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything . 
it is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists . 
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the maimed . 
the Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the Sovie@@ ts . 
they want to defend their traditions , both ancient and archaic , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uzbe@@ ks , Taj@@ i@@ ks . 
tolerated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when W@@ ester@@ ners become more scarce . 
the departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of al@@ mond trees planted with French funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion . 
con@@ voys of trucks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , over@@ flown by helicopters . 
there will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014 . 
circumstances have changed since their ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible advance between 1994 and 1996 . 
at that time Kabul was empty , the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions . 
their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to safety . 
Afgh@@ anis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of Al@@ -@@ Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today . 
former Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position . 
the main anti@@ -@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 . 
they became profiteers , seizing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts . 
they have become discredited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves . 
the people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thieves . 
many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American larg@@ esse will leave : the flight of capital is considerable . 
the young people are tired of war and its ideologies . 
they have rub@@ bed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits . 
roughly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population . 
in towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike . 
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders . 
all of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish soap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere . 
the army is now present . 
will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ? 
former comm@@ anders of the anti@@ -@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power . 
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State , with strong presidential power , abolishing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution . 
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 . 
but , since the 5@@ 0s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid . 
no industries have been re@@ -@@ established , no dams are in good condition , no major irrigation systems have been repaired . 
everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables . 
the Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative . 
in a country ruined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary . 
the rumour was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth . 
this only added to the feeling that the W@@ ester@@ ners were only there to seize it . 
with no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining . 
the Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es Ay@@ na@@ k copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province . 
one day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations . 
the departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November . 
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological Delegation . 
since 2009 , to try to " win hearts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions , a " civil@@ -@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ IM@@ IC ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NGO , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages . 
these projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insurgency : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas . 
what will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ? 
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2@@ ,000 metres above sea level . 
the Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in K@@ ap@@ isa province . 
to be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them . 
a Constitution by force in Egypt 
a new gamble for President Mohammed Mor@@ si . 
while Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke . 
taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day . 
just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work . 
for two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os . 
this new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country . 
according to his opponents , the President is persever@@ ing in his " autocratic deli@@ ri@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' trample the law . " 
his supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process . 
a referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks . 
a very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyptians . 
for the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute r@@ ages throughout the country . 
Mohammed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time . 
particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : " either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , " these powers supposedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution . 
it was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islamist majority , voted on the text yesterday . 
most of the liberals were missing . 
in mid@@ -@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slam@@ med the door , feeling they had failed to assert their views . 
Representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise . 
in order to obtain a quorum , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were hastily added yesterday morning . 
some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood . 
not surprisingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously . 
commentators were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong . 
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 2@@ 34 articles . 
the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stipulating that " the principles of sharia are the main source of law . " 
the Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed stricter application . 
for the Islamists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society . 
" hypocrisy " respond the liberals , who see only a communication coup . 
because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles . 
they refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al@@ -@@ Az@@ har University an advisory role , with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia . 
according to Egypt specialist S@@ op@@ hi@@ e P@@ omm@@ ier , this is worrying because " the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy . 
this suggests the beginnings of a theoc@@ racy . " 
the liberals ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one . 
" for the time being , there is no concrete religious implication . 
with this Constitution , things remain under civil rule . 
most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law schol@@ ars but academics , some trained in the French system " qualifies Alex@@ is Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition . 
but he acknowledges that " there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220 , because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary . 
reference is made in particular to " fi@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic jurisprudence , Ed@@ itor 's note ] . 
and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it . " 
beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic . 
the Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime . 
another issue : the powers conferred on the army . 
in accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council . 
nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribunals , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights . 
who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repressive . 
the offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press . 
in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights He@@ ba Mor@@ ay@@ ef , from Human Rights Watch . 
in her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 . 
the word was not included in the previous Constitution . 
while the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon . 
supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday . 
in Israel , holy places await Ukrainian tourists , the om@@ phal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water 
the Holy Land combines the spl@@ end@@ our of biblical truths , modern comfort and prim@@ eval nature . 
AI@@ F [ Ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent@@ i i F@@ ak@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel . 
let 's worship the holy places 
it is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tized . 
it is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism " bath " are blessed by God . 
Galil@@ ee is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned water into wine at a w@@ edding , walked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and filled the nets . 
this is also where Jesus came before his disci@@ ples and after the resurrec@@ tion . 
but the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem . 
believers walk through the W@@ ay of Gri@@ ef or Via Dol@@ or@@ os@@ a . 
it starts by the Anton@@ ia Fortress - Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old T@@ own to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ th@@ a - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ ion , Stone of Un@@ c@@ tion and the place of Jesus ' burial . 
this is also the location of the symbolic Christian om@@ phal@@ os , which symbo@@ li@@ zes the salvation of mankind . 
the Holy Cross Mon@@ ast@@ ery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that , according to Christian leg@@ end , yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus ' cruci@@ fix@@ ion . 
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD . 
according to tradition , people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled . 
travel along a vertical 
ruins of the M@@ assad@@ a Fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family . 
they are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level . 
they can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain clim@@ bing . 
others are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way . 
in the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00@@ -@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which fills up with tourists in winter months . 
a shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain . 
the total length of ski p@@ ist@@ es is 45 km . 
according to an ancient leg@@ end , p@@ agan gods used to live on the mountain . 
visit unique museums 
this country has about 300 museums . 
you won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip 
but at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit . 
among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Knesset ( Parliament ) . 
it has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts and De@@ ad Sea sc@@ rolls found in the ca@@ ves of the Ju@@ dean desert , along with about 5@@ 00,000 archaeological and anthropo@@ logical ar@@ te@@ facts . 
the Museum of Ar@@ t in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv is also interesting . 
its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Ren@@ o@@ ir , Sis@@ ley , C@@ ez@@ anne , Ma@@ tis@@ se , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , P@@ ic@@ as@@ so . 
in Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al@@ -@@ Bash@@ a , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish ba@@ ths with models of visitors and bath attend@@ ants of the time . 
in Caes@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the s@@ culp@@ tures of Dal@@ i and R@@ od@@ in . 
there are no tour guides or gift shops . 
entry is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed . 
the fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ as@@ hem in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history . 
the most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers . 
you go in and find yourself in complete darkness . 
stars are glim@@ mering , 
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died . 
Ukraine is mentioned there too . 
well@@ ness 
there are three resort areas in Israel , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and De@@ ad Seas . 
each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dolph@@ in@@ aria and oc@@ e@@ an@@ aria . 
it is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees . 
the De@@ ad Sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round . 
incidentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level . 
its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you afloat , even if you don 't know how to swim . 
the surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty . 
people come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wrap@@ s and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ ma@@ ti@@ tis , allergies , asth@@ mas , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as , ar@@ thri@@ tis , bron@@ chi@@ tis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance . 
touch the myster@@ ies of antiqu@@ ity 
they are preserved in the old section of Tel@@ -@@ Aviv - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea . 
the famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , Anat@@ o@@ lia , and Mesopotamia runs through it . 
the city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian leg@@ ends . 
according to leg@@ ends , this is where No@@ ah built his ar@@ k and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beauty An@@ dro@@ med@@ a , with whom he lived a long and happy life . 
tourists really like to w@@ ander the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac . 
they say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you . 
in J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions . 
and in Caes@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , " capture " the C@@ rus@@ ader fortress . 
during the Roman period , Caes@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Roman pre@@ fec@@ ts , including Pontius Pilate . 
the carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concer@@ ts and opera performances . 
a note for the tourist 
when you go to Israel , don 't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian . 
for the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for she@@ k@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.8 she@@ k@@ els ) . 
city transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high@@ -@@ speed tr@@ am , and Hai@@ fa has the only sub@@ way line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower . 
in essence , it is an underground cable railway . 
a ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 she@@ k@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers . 
according to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bath is celebrated in Israel . 
between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working . 
the work week starts on Sunday morning . 
many caf@@ es , restaurants and hotels have only ko@@ sh@@ er food , with no pork , sea@@ food , fish with no scales , or dishes that combine milk with meat . 
there is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef , sou@@ ps and d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts cooked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus pa@@ ste , various sa@@ uc@@ es , fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l ( b@@ alls made of ground chic@@ k@@ peas ) , fruits and vegetables . 
the streets of Israel don 't have homeless dogs . 
but there are many well@@ -@@ fed cats , which walk around la@@ z@@ ily . 
in the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on ro@@ ofs of par@@ ked cars . 
these pus@@ sy@@ cats like busy places and do not refuse treats . 
car rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ und@@ ai Ge@@ tz ) to 188 ( Aud@@ i A6 , Volvo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day . 
plus insurance of 15 dollars a day . 
bi@@ ke rental costs 15 she@@ k@@ els a day . 
Museum entrance costs 30 she@@ k@@ els on average . 
in numbers 
in 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel . 
visitors and holidaymakers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine . 
between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 . 
only the " high and mighty " make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language 
while deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates . 
every year , 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia . 
mostly these are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan . 
their only goal is to earn money to support families back home . 
a new law came into effect on December 1 , which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test . 
for the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail . 
but with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non@@ -@@ residents . 
in addition to language , Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested . 
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit . 
an exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language . 
people who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also exempt under the law . 
purpose , doomed fate , and the protection of rights 
seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Peoples ' Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions . 
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened . 
the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services . 
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ? 
what will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non@@ -@@ residents ? 
first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery . 
many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Viktor Se@@ bel@@ ev . 
rights protection should begin before their departure . 
only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers . 
migrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems . 
if a migrant does not understand the language , says Se@@ bel@@ ev with certainty , he is doomed to come across un@@ conscientious people , who , pretending to help , will force upon him a " ticket " to terrible , cr@@ amped bar@@ racks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12@@ -@@ 14 hours a day . 
we receive many complaints from our migrants . 
" they are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , " confirms the Head of the M@@ ain Mi@@ grant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v . 
not be angry , boss ! 
nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language . 
naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , Uzbe@@ ks , and Taj@@ i@@ ks can afford even a basic education . 
their families don 't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies . 
after reaching adolesc@@ ence , these ki@@ ds go to work at the first opportunity . 
it is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit . 
" you feel humiliated and inferior . " 
but human rights activists note one important point about the law on language . 
testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status . 
if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future . 
in the meantime , most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally . 
" welcome , or No Un@@ authorized En@@ try " 
many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy . 
the reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties . 
in addition , legalization costs money : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 rub@@ les . 
whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand . 
officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extortion . 
" they ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , " U@@ med Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ adam@@ ov , a citizen of Tajikistan , shared with journalists . 
" roll up , don 't be cheap , get your ar@@ t@@ work " 
on the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake . 
a few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already . 
forged documents are printed on a standard colour pr@@ inter . 
naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them . 
it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand . 
government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought . 
for the moment , the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course . 
in addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people . 
the Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation 
the share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low 
the Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tough@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons . 
this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : click shots at wed@@ dings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmit@@ ry V@@ ino@@ grad@@ ov , resulting in C@@ L@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people . 
policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 . 
the idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and An@@ ti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ ar@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future . 
not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " tightening the scre@@ ws . " 
an open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the " senseless tough@@ ening . " 
the percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ ly L@@ es@@ ni@@ kov to BBC Russia . 
according to the Ministry of the Interior 's statistics , 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period . 
authors of the open letter are certain that the tough@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market . 
according to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now . 
nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control . 
suppliers : from plants to officers 
the " black " market of weapons is replen@@ ished through several channels . 
there are five such channels , explains retired colon@@ el Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years . 
scre@@ en@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons . 
first : " Army or military loo@@ t , " i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus . 
" weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Cauc@@ asi@@ ans , " says Bar@@ an@@ ets . 
next are " black weapons , " stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies . 
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police ware@@ houses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees . 
illegal arms are taken to be sold from military ware@@ houses . 
explosions have often been heard at military ware@@ houses . 
" there are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , " says the former military man . 
manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets . 
" there are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert . 
another source of the " black " market is trafficking . 
an especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan . 
" there 's production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a mafia has formed , which has organized a stream , " explains the former military man . 
where do the weapons come from ? 
experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market . 
a report about this was prepared by the Centre of Pro@@ blem@@ s An@@ alysis and Public Management Planning in 2011 . 
experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ros@@ st@@ at , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from port@@ als on weapons . 
the overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces . 
half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , " states the report . 
according to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black archae@@ ology . " 
a sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asserts that the weapons found by " black " di@@ ggers are not being bought any more , because they 're too old . 
according to him , dealers go to the military ware@@ house for a new batch of goods . 
one piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer . 
it is issued to him , and given through the fence . 
" he takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , " he says . 
" the truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants , " says the consultant . 
" like in a luxury store " 
the buyer and seller often find each other through friends . 
I looked at sites , b@@ logs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ v@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " corner " so we can negotiate . 
I found out the price of the weapon only there 
military comment@@ ator Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets 
to get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consultant . - I have an acquain@@ tance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable . 
there are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to " come " there conditionally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth . " 
right now , even if I need a few kn@@ uck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust . 
he also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away . 
beg@@ in@@ ners look for weapons in different ways . 
former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid@@ -@@ 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this . 
the formulas are still the same , according to him . 
he was given an al@@ bu@@ m of pictures with " anything and everything . " 
" I felt like I was in a luxury store , " he recalls . 
according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything . 
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there . 
" I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , " describes the expert . 
store on a sof@@ a 
Internet searches lead to sites and " V@@ k@@ on@@ ta@@ k@@ te " groups , where weapons " for different purposes " are on offer . 
no documents or personal meetings are needed . 
" it 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the advertisement heading on the website " Bu@@ y a p@@ is@@ tol or ri@@ f@@ le . " 
users leave their requests and ask questions . 
can a minor buy ? 
" without a license , of course , " asks user " John " ( name is changed ) . 
" want to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , " concisely requests " Fed@@ o@@ ren@@ kov . " 
federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons . 
people come like hungry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Siberia . 
military comment@@ ator and former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets 
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia . 
people accept orders . 
the buyer pays at an AT@@ M . 
" in response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , " says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non@@ -@@ governmental organization Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ lov . 
Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail . 
the Federal Security Service now spreads a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons . 
" people are like hungry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Siberia mining coal , " - he says . 
M@@ ak@@ ar@@ ov for 100 dollars 
when buying illegal firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts . 
according to Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ lov from the Rights to Weapons organization , a M@@ ak@@ ar@@ ov gun can be acquired for 100@@ -@@ 300 dollars . 
the wait time is a month to a month and a half . 
it is shipped from long@@ -@@ term storage ware@@ houses by the mid@@ -@@ level management of these ware@@ houses . 
according to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to J@@ anu@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ October 2011 , amounting to 22@@ ,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % . 
fast@@ -@@ food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.@@ S@@ .@@ A. 
up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at Mc@@ Donald 's at one time or another 
in the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.@@ S@@ .@@ A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like Mc@@ Donald 's , B@@ urg@@ er King , Tac@@ o Bel@@ l , W@@ end@@ y 's and K@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky Fri@@ ed Chic@@ ken . 
right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fi@@ zz@@ le out early . 
actions are being supported by unions and a series of lef@@ t@@ -@@ wing organizations . 
in addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them . 
this sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet . 
46 cents a year ? 
actions began last week after Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes . 
on this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and pic@@ keted together with the unions and lef@@ t@@ -@@ wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ medium incomes . 
Wal@@ mar@@ t sells everything imaginable , from di@@ apers , hunting ri@@ f@@ les and car batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , eggs and milk . 
products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets . 
so many low@@ -@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace . 
availability and assor@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corporations . 
according to critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees . 
these latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand@@ -@@ held scanners . 
protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month . 
a typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employee , receiving 9.5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this . 
scientists from the Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars . 
this is about 1.1 % more than it spends on salaries right now . 
if Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more . 
in one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now . 
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation . 
black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5@@ 000 products a second . 
in total , its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday . 
representative of the corporation , Dan Fo@@ gel@@ man , asserted in an interview with a lef@@ t@@ -@@ wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , that a total of " less than five " Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just " another PR trick " of the union that organized it . 
" free cash register ! " 
protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don 't exist here yet ) , but Mc@@ Donald 's and other cheap restaurants . 
Mc@@ Donald 's says that it sells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! 
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Wil@@ liam@@ s , member of the City Council of New York 
at the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour . 
fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour . 
nobody earns less in this expensive city . 
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money . 
once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through Mc@@ Donald 's , working part@@ -@@ time after school , living with parents . 
few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long . 
now I continuously come across interviews with Mc@@ Donald 's employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children . 
on the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them . 
participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Donald 's on 40th street and Mad@@ ison A@@ venue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and coo@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages . 
they also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry . 
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by n@@ agging or firing . 
on the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life . 
but for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union . 
one of them is the unusual turnover of employees . 
dis@@ agreeing 
noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Man@@ h@@ att@@ an . 
the highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Donald 's by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Wil@@ liam@@ s , said : " Mc@@ Donald 's claims it sells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! " 
demonstrators were supported by other prominent N@@ Y democrats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city mayor , who said : " we need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . " 
according to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry . 
but only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York . 
it is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement . 
" at the moment , the mind cannot be deceived too well " 
among modern technology fans a popular topic is aug@@ mented reality , lately seen primarily through the pr@@ ism of special glasses . 
at first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too . 
however , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3@@ D technologies in the Cam@@ bridge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ ram Iz@@ ad@@ i , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company . 
they are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces . 
- P@@ lease tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does . 
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction . 
while people in general are stuck at working with pi@@ x@@ els on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them . 
we want to look 5@@ -@@ 10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction . 
for example , X@@ box and Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors are a step forward . almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ec@@ t today , because everyone likes control by gestures . 
- What else awaits us in the future ? 
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ec@@ t shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3@@ D . 
information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better . 
we are trying to change this , working on truly thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projection technologies . 
we need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible . 
but for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him . 
then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form . 
above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality hel@@ me@@ ts ! 
- What do you think about voice control ? 
it 's a popular thing , but is it overestimated ? 
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions . 
in reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own niche . 
for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones . 
movements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand brac@@ elet that determined the movement of bones and muscles . 
it 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch . 
in general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.g. movement + voice . 
- What do you mean ? 
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ? 
you will talk and show at the same time . 
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say . 
- O@@ h , that will be very hard to detect . 
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ? 
- No@@ t necessarily , but it is a mutual approximation . 
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sen@@ sors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction . 
this could be , e.g. las@@ er sen@@ sors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very important . 
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ? 
not enough resolution , depth or something else ? 
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional recognition . 
of course , it would be good to have eight mega pi@@ x@@ els with 1000 k / s speed . 
it 's not just the mega pi@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the matri@@ x and the depth . 
from the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m design@@ ers . 
so it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z axis . 
speed , the number of images per second , is also very important . 
human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gestures . 
Ste@@ ven B@@ ath@@ ic@@ he from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sen@@ sor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern seri@@ al sen@@ sors are closer to the latter indicator ( 6@@ 0@@ -@@ 100 ) . 
not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine . 
in my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second . 
- Do@@ es the number of cameras need to be increased ? 
- In Kin@@ ec@@ t there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red emit@@ ter and the second one , the recipient of the signal . 
the third one is actually a regular sen@@ sor of visible range . 
it is not applied to determine the object 's depth . 
potentially , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ... 
or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations . 
it would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kin@@ ec@@ t , play with the flex@@ ion of camera disposition and see how this will help in thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional determination of the position . 
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public , unlike Google . 
Don 't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of aug@@ mented reality technologies ? 
- C@@ erta@@ in@@ ly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the co@@ ol@@ est option would be " transitional " aug@@ mented reality , where you could shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform . 
glasses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - aug@@ mented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people . 
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual ho@@ lo@@ graphic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from I@@ ron@@ man , but to a regular person . 
there is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no t@@ acti@@ le feedback ! 
hands feel nothing ! 
what answers does your group prepare to this challenge ? 
- In my lectures I often say that aug@@ mented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine . 
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of t@@ acti@@ le sen@@ s@@ ations . 
for now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matri@@ x for the image . 
it is great at registering pushes ! 
but there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tan@@ gibility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultr@@ as@@ ound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your finger@@ tip . 
there are also wr@@ ist brac@@ el@@ ets that affect the nerve end@@ ings in fingers , which is also a promising area . 
- H@@ ave you tried to deceive the mind ? 
to force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ? 
- This is a good idea and we haven 't tried this yet . 
it conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limitless space ; we are working on the concept of t@@ read@@ mills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant bal@@ lo@@ ons . 
so far deceiving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come . 
that 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings . 
judgement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ r@@ u 
Ros@@ bal@@ t continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de of culture and art . 
this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , bypassing f@@ ame in Russia . 
the new player in Ros@@ bal@@ t - the bold artist Kir@@ ill Miller . 
the whole city knows Kir@@ ill Miller , a be@@ ar@@ ded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Sum@@ mer Gar@@ den , or at fashionable parties and shows . 
Kir@@ ill Miller 's work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited . 
Kir@@ ill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ers and creators of new myth@@ ology . 
Kir@@ ill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de of the late 80 's early 90 's . 
moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit . 
recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohem@@ ian existence , philosophy and image . 
- Kir@@ ill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or tur@@ quo@@ ise , for example ? 
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image . 
in this world , red is a compromise between artist , imag@@ e@@ -@@ maker and society . 
although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind . 
but my provocations are aimed at starting conversation . 
the whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion . 
- When did you realise that you must be an artist ? 
- At an exhibition in the N@@ ev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed . 
it became clear to me that this is my path . 
then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood . 
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post@@ -@@ Gaz@@ a@@ -@@ N@@ ev@@ sky style artists ( " post@@ -@@ ga@@ z@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina " ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer . 
I 'm drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for literature . 
- And all this has been united in your Ar@@ t@@ -@@ clin@@ ic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together . 
in 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Bohem@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Bohem@@ ia . 
many were born there : N@@ omy , T@@ equ@@ ila J@@ az@@ z , I remember when Sh@@ n@@ ur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh 's E@@ ar project . 
Sh@@ n@@ ur and his friends lip sang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now tren@@ dy compos@@ er I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ vin was with them . 
when the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ingrad . 
Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the pres@@ enter of many programs before H@@ ali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times . 
we gave them Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us . 
Gall@@ ery D 137 , Gri@@ boy@@ ed@@ ov club - all these echo the Ar@@ t@@ -@@ clin@@ ic . 
that is where our staff and regular customers left for . 
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something . 
in 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize . 
I was nominated Ar@@ tist of the Year , my climax came to an end . 
in the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century . 
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . you can be popular , but not very cultural . 
- Your work is marked by a recogn@@ iz@@ able style . 
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity . 
I will have a programme exhi@@ bit , " Russian museum in c@@ low@@ ns . " 
c@@ low@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category . 
I was social before , now it is painful and sc@@ ary to be like that . 
but everything is blurred in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed . 
I like grotesque , I have grotesque ideas . 
for example , saving the world by totalitarian changing of clothes by order . 
nowadays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities . 
who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face . 
and the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes . 
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character . 
who fits the role better than I ? 
- May@@ be commercial art can also be beautiful ? 
- N@@ ow@@ adays , commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , sweet . 
there is a disintegration of cultures . 
people used to get together in f@@ locks , Bohem@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else . 
now , everybody is divided into micro societies , it 's hard to be liked by everyone . 
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all . 
now you have to think who you will please . 
now , each cult hero has 100 fans . 
- But several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ ilov ! 
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sex@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ social sphere is at work there . 
but 300 people will come for culture , not 10@@ ,000 . in the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out . 
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betray them , not to spoil what I have earned . 
in my youth , I painted such art that one collec@@ tor had it hanging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and Lari@@ on@@ ov . 
I started with pain@@ tings , which people usually end with . 
concepts are often mixed up these days . 
people say : spiritual culture , consumer culture . 
there is no culture in consumerism , it 's " from another opera . " 
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting . 
this is the culture I 'm for . 
- Kir@@ ill , what is St. Petersburg missing ? 
- Good cultural experts . 
there is such a thing : an official for culture . 
but not everyone can be engaged in culture . 
under the right rulers everything was different . K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts . 
there are good consultants in Moscow right now . 
here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them . 
judgement calls are what thrive now . 
even Er@@ art , but they 're different because they say honestly that we don 't accept all modern art . there are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves . 
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ? 
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedrock there . 
it 's hard for art to grow on our rocks . 
we need cultural bedrock , but we now have more writers than readers . this is wrong . 
in Europe , there are many curious people , who go to art exhi@@ bits , concer@@ ts . 
here , this layer is thin . 
we need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century . 
the project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant . 
give birth in space 
the earth is in danger . 
global warming or an encounter with a killer ast@@ ero@@ id . 
carav@@ ans of co@@ sm@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet . 
to save humanity , the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weigh@@ t@@ lessness or on that replacement planet ? 
I think the choice is small . 
there are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explored even hypothe@@ tically . 
" Ven@@ us and Mar@@ s , " says Sen@@ ior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K@@ . Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ str@@ onom@@ y Institute ( G@@ AI@@ S@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ din . 
but while conditions on Mar@@ s are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degree temperatures . 
life is possible only at a high al@@ titude or on the orbit of Ven@@ us ... in space . 
the question of reproduction in space began with flora . 
half a century ago , experiments were run on plants . 
four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts . 
then , insects were bred in orbit , small fruit flies . 
in 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embryo develops in weigh@@ t@@ lessness . 
we get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick . 
but then the problem begins . 
" the problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , " explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Pro@@ blem@@ s ( IM@@ BP ) RA@@ N Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v . 
having found no support , chic@@ ks were t@@ umbling around in disorder . 
after 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete atro@@ phy of instincts . 
chic@@ ks did not react to light and sound . 
and the problem was that they simply died after four days . 
" we bred chic@@ ks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confirming the failure of the experiment with chic@@ ks in space . 
the last biological " mini@@ -@@ ar@@ k " with animals fle@@ w into orbit 16 years ago . 
in spring 2013 , experiments will continue . 
however , only s@@ ame@@ -@@ sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bio@@ -@@ satellite . 
there was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with foet@@ us . 
in principle , there was nothing extraordinary there . 
" this was on bio@@ -@@ satellites , but again , it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v . 
after landing , the co@@ sm@@ ic rats had babies . 
but it 's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space . 
it 's not an easy task . 
animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct , when they 're out of their familiar environment . 
in principle , people , unlike animals , can . 
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens have abstract thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background . 
such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons . 
but women have been flying to space for 50 years . 
the biggest risk was for Te@@ resh@@ ko@@ va . 
the most valuable thing for humanity is the female body . 
our " Se@@ ag@@ ull " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space . 
whether she will be able to give birth after this flight . 
" nobody answered this question , " says rocket and space industry veter@@ an , V@@ akh@@ tan@@ g V@@ ach@@ nadze . 
in June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Valent@@ ina Te@@ resh@@ ko@@ va gave birth to a daughter . 
the child 's father , Andri@@ an Nik@@ ola@@ ev , was also a co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut . 
in 1988 , the second woman co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut , S@@ ve@@ t@@ lan@@ a Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son . 
however , the risk remains . 
we have few , very few co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights . 
" what 's more , it is dangerous even for or@@ b@@ ital flights , " adds pilot and co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut , Her@@ o of the USSR , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov . 
and yet , humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity . 
Hydro@@ -@@ laboratory of C@@ P@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight . 
here , co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o@@ -@@ gravity conditions . 
water im@@ it@@ ates weigh@@ t@@ lessness . 
if for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for infants it is a native element . 
small amp@@ hi@@ bians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean . 
there is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ otic fluid in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that . 
in principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing . 
" this is very little time to forget something , " says infant swimming instruc@@ tor Mar@@ ina Ak@@ sen@@ ova . 
in other words , if for a newborn weigh@@ t@@ lessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth 's pull . 
stomach and pel@@ vic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weigh@@ t@@ lessness ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced . 
well , let 's assume that childbirth stimul@@ ators will work out . 
maybe she will push out the baby in a special room . 
" then what ? " - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non@@ -@@ trivial issue . 
on the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity . 
when a body does not feel the earth 's pull , it does not form the skelet@@ al and mus@@ cul@@ ar system . 
it is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults . 
he will simply not have what he needs to survive . 
" and this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handicapped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , " predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IM@@ BP RA@@ N I@@ g@@ or P@@ est@@ ov . 
for the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory . 
however , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space . 
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians . 
the Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application . 
this was said by Mil@@ os@@ lav K@@ ala , vic@@ e@@ -@@ president of the Supreme Audit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
" the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states K@@ ala , commenting on the current situation . 
similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors . 
as an example of improper practice , they cite Pe@@ t@@ r N@@ ec@@ as 's approach to the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ var@@ c System . " 
the Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ? 
" the Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is du@@ ty@@ -@@ bound to monitor and enforce , " asserts K@@ ala . 
at the audit committee 's session in the House of Deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared . 
what exactly was this about ? 
this is about parallel auditing , which we began around two years ago . 
simply put , this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself . 
we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more concise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany . 
this confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws . 
what does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ? 
this kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact . 
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided . 
however , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be procu@@ red . 
the system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork , and those , who wish to look for loopholes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher . 
these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts . 
how does the audit system work in Germany ? 
is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ? 
as far as the office is concerned , the Bundes@@ rec@@ h@@ n@@ ung@@ sh@@ of functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly . 
powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own . 
the BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds . 
public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there . 
when it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ? 
overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect . 
is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ? 
that is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such comparisons . 
it should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary , they encounter a whole range of problems . 
if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ? 
coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ? 
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet . 
since we carry out our audits ex@@ -@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account . 
as yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk detection " system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on . 
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ? 
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed . 
a problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes " too constrained " and will not be enforceable . 
under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline . 
is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ? 
I do not think this is the way . 
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a technic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision . 
this kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy . 
so how can we get out of this ? 
let 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us . 
the Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ var@@ c System " - what does this mean ? 
is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ? 
the Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohibits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is du@@ ty@@ -@@ bound to monitor and enforce . 
he may say : " let us change this law and relax it , " but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there . 
the law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected . 
on the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ dder with the best offer is excluded on a technic@@ ality . 
the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . 
roads are icy in places , but mostly pass@@ able . 
in several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snow@@ y . 
however , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places . 
Carl@@ s@@ bad region 
in the Carl@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snow@@ y . 
the temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day . 
snow@@ ing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands . 
however , the rid@@ ges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mountains have around 30 centi@@ metres of snow . 
in some locations there is limited visibility due to mis@@ t , according to the local highway service . 
the R@@ 6 high@@ -@@ speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction . 
caution is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and slippery . 
all secondary and tertiary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads . 
in certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow pat@@ ches . 
above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving . 
Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice and H@@ rad@@ e@@ c Kr@@ alo@@ ve region 
on some roads in Eastern Bohem@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher alti@@ tudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Mo@@ tor@@ way Directorate . 
the highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher alti@@ tudes of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice region in particular . 
black ice may occur around L@@ ans@@ k@@ rou@@ n , U@@ sti na@@ d Or@@ lic@@ i , Po@@ lic@@ ky , S@@ vit@@ av@@ y , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads . 
the I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y . 
snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ k@@ on@@ ose and Or@@ lic@@ ke mountains . 
at higher alti@@ tudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ ch@@ no@@ v na@@ d K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tru@@ t@@ no@@ v . 
in Eastern Bohem@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry . 
temperatures will be between minus three and plus one degree Cel@@ sius mostly , with a light wind . 
Pil@@ sen region 
the roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . drivers should take the weather conditions into account . 
the morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero . 
due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be icy . 
drivers should expect mis@@ t in places , though visibility will gradually improve . 
this information was reported by the region 's highway service . 
the D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 8@@ 0th and 13@@ 1st kilometre marks . 
most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ st@@ -@@ free . 
southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and Tac@@ ho@@ v regions may have icy pat@@ ches . 
secondary and tertiary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy pat@@ ches . 
drivers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Bohem@@ ian Forest . 
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 
drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region . 
it is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to V@@ id@@ el@@ sky K@@ ri@@ z . 
snow@@ plough@@ s were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three centi@@ metres of snow . 
in other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions . 
" in the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest alti@@ tudes . 
drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ s@@ ke sed@@ lo in the direction of J@@ es@@ eni@@ k , " the dispatch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told C@@ T@@ K today . 
their J@@ es@@ eni@@ k counterparts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest alti@@ tudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them . 
the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region 's roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of Ster@@ n@@ ber@@ k drivers should beware in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet . 
U@@ sti na@@ d La@@ be@@ m region , Li@@ be@@ re@@ c region 
since this morning , the snow@@ plough@@ s have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Bohem@@ ia . 
besides certain snow@@ -@@ covered places , or some icy fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to K@@ nin@@ ice in the U@@ sti na@@ d La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database . 
temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and icy . in the low@@ lands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Bohem@@ ian U@@ pl@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry . 
no traffic hol@@ d@@ -@@ ups have so far been reported . 
icy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti . 
according to meteor@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and freezing temperatures . 
adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti na@@ d La@@ be@@ m and Li@@ be@@ re@@ c regions . 
the closure of the Tel@@ nice to K@@ nin@@ ice road was caused by bent tree branches , which were weighed down to road level by snow@@ fall . 
Simon Or@@ nest : at the concer@@ ts we want a fusion of positive energy 
what is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ? 
it is just another start@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to . 
together with The T@@ ap T@@ ap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely . 
in December you are even organising a unique series of three concer@@ ts against the end of the world . 
can you give our readers some details on this ? 
this is a nationwide fund@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years . 
we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m. 
on the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ p@@ m , 3 concer@@ ts will take place in parallel in Prague , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va . 
they will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bati Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar . 
who came up with this idea ? 
initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Au@@ gu@@ sta . 
apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children . 
on the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t@@ -@@ shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at ww@@ w@@ .e@@ -@@ ta@@ p.@@ cz to support our cause . 
the T@@ ap T@@ ap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so@@ -@@ called anthem against the end of the world , called " The En@@ d of the World is cancelled . " 
it is already well received on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , will it figure at the fund@@ -@@ raising concer@@ ts ? 
of course , for the grand fin@@ ale , as long as the world does not end beforehand . 
it will be sun@@ g by all the artists at all the three concer@@ ts at the same time . 
the anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television . 
the words were written and the role of Jesus in the video cli@@ p was played by Tom@@ as Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ... 
how did you end up working with them ? 
we collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund@@ -@@ raising events and concer@@ ts ... 
we try to really get them involved in these projects . 
it turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us . 
what will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ? 
equipping the wheel@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational stu@@ de@@ o centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association T@@ ap from the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute for the disabled . 
tu@@ tors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them . 
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tu@@ tors , so we try to provide this for them in this way . 
within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project . 
every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists . 
how do you select them ? 
we have tried to compile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children . 
for example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support L@@ es@@ bi@@ ens , Il@@ lu@@ strat@@ o@@ sphere with Dan Bar@@ ta , The T@@ ap T@@ ap , Marian Ban@@ go and J@@ iri S@@ uc@@ hy will appear . 
further details can be found at ww@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
are you planning any more " bom@@ bas@@ tic events " in the future ? 
in May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good lin@@ e@@ -@@ up with some interesting guests . 
next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago . 
your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow . 
the T@@ ap T@@ ap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people . 
how do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation ? 
it is not as sc@@ ary as it might seem at first . 
we have five members in electric wheel@@ chairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ... 
nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , C@@ SA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised . 
even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly . 
thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on . 
what have been your experiences so far ? 
after Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings . 
compared to Prague , Moscow is rather inaccessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own . 
obvious things , such as giving wheel@@ chairs priority in lifts , are not commonplace there . 
fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities . 
and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ? 
there are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ... 
it is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected . 
in London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public , and they can use the toil@@ ets , go to the museum , or wherever ... 
it is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The T@@ ap T@@ ap we are a step ahead ! 
public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change . 
so far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong@@ -@@ wil@@ led . 
the T@@ ap T@@ ap band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ? 
I began my job as a tu@@ tor at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something . 
since I am a musi@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague . 
with time , as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya An@@ g@@ elo@@ vic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) . 
your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistaken ? 
it is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sing@@ ers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band . 
we realised that work , which goes on unseen can be like it never existed . 
thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tu@@ tors , equipment and so on . 
was it your goal to take The T@@ ap T@@ ap to such heights ? 
from the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently . 
show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ ates the other . 
it is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time . 
things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that T@@ ap T@@ ap is one of those things . 
a person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ... 
but that pity is simply wasted , because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ tied . 
they are people , who can fully live life and blos@@ som , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it . 
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole . 
has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ? 
if we want to achieve top class work , we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline . 
I think this is to be expected . 
some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehear@@ sals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concer@@ ts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears . 
that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something . 
the T@@ ap T@@ ap band currently has twenty members . 
how many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ? 
only one , Lad@@ ya An@@ g@@ elo@@ vic . 
we are an open group , people come and people go , this is unavoidable . 
those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open . 
the event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ p@@ m . 
the venues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ che@@ ba , Br@@ no F@@ led@@ a , and O@@ stra@@ va Pl@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic . 
all three cities will be joined by a televised link@@ -@@ up at the evening 's close for a united rendition of The T@@ ap T@@ ap 's anthem " The En@@ d of the World is cancelled " 
the concert 's goal is to raise funds to equip the stu@@ de@@ o multi@@ -@@ functional wheel@@ -@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crow@@ ns . 
admission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a@@ ticket . 
Poland and the Co@@ smo@@ s . 
last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008 ) . 
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects . 
of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier . 
Polish bo@@ ff@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding . 
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A Ster@@ n@@ feld in Warsaw 's astronom@@ y observatory , who , on the 6th of December 1933 , presented ideas on his pioneering work En@@ try into space . 
the thoughts of the young engineer ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later Ster@@ n@@ feld remembered that only Dr@@ . Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work . 
in 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , Ster@@ n@@ feld received the Robert Es@@ na@@ ul@@ t@@ -@@ Pel@@ terie and And@@ re Louis H@@ ir@@ sch prize in France . 
the above mentioned Dr@@ . Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promoter of astronom@@ y and astr@@ onau@@ tics . 
he published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects . 
G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a world@@ -@@ known promoter of astr@@ onau@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him . 
in 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine . 
unfortunately , both the project 's designer , and the project 's details , are unknown . 
it is not even clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down . 
information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time . 
in 1933 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in flying bombs . 
the research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof@@ . Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof@@ . Gu@@ sta@@ w Mo@@ kr@@ z@@ yc@@ ki . 
from the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests . 
of course , the advance of the German army interrupted the research . 
in 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing rocket designed by engineer Ro@@ ho@@ z@@ in@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Roc@@ ket - air torpe@@ do and flying roc@@ ket@@ -@@ bomb appeared , auth@@ ored by L@@ eli@@ w@@ y@@ -@@ K@@ ry@@ w@@ ob@@ loc@@ ki . 
both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines . 
immediately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Pro@@ vis@@ ional Scientific Advisory Board ( T@@ ym@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y K@@ om@@ it@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ N@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work . 
the Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War . 
further work devoted to astr@@ onau@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ str@@ onau@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie Tow@@ ar@@ zy@@ st@@ w@@ o A@@ str@@ onau@@ ty@@ cz@@ ne ) . 
the first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Pro@@ blem@@ s in 195@@ 4 , in which four in@@ -@@ depth articles are on the subject of astr@@ onau@@ tics . 
in one of these , by Prof@@ . Su@@ bo@@ tow@@ icz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedicate itself to astr@@ onau@@ tics . 
at the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that co@@ sm@@ ic research was an emerging sector . 
from the beginning of 1956 , the Polish A@@ str@@ onau@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International A@@ str@@ onau@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member . 
in the following year , the P@@ TA 's first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ i@@ er@@ z Z@@ ar@@ an@@ kiewicz ( 19@@ 02 - 1959 ) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International A@@ str@@ onau@@ tics Federation . 
he served in this capacity until his death in 1959 . 
from 1956 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets R@@ M ( ra@@ ki@@ eta Me@@ teor@@ o@@ log@@ ic@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research . 
the first R@@ M@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 . 
the rocket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 metres , measured around 80 c@@ m in length and weighed a little under 5 kg . 
later , the improved R@@ M@@ -@@ 1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two@@ -@@ stage R@@ M@@ -@@ 2 rocket in the B@@ led@@ ow@@ sky Des@@ ert . 
the rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg . 
a further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M@@ -@@ 34 rocket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be tasked with monitoring high al@@ titude winds . 
of course , in 1962 further research was stopped . 
the successor to the R@@ M rocket type was the Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 1 rocket , developed from 1962 to 1965 . 
the rocket was designed as a two@@ -@@ stage rocket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg . 
three models were developed ( designated Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 1A , -@@ 1B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus . 
in the Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 1A rocket , a space of 0.4 litres was available , Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 1B had 0.@@ 34 litres , and Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 litres . 
the maximum al@@ titude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km . 
between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 2 was underway in the A@@ er@@ onau@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 . 
the Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 6@@ 0@@ km . 
subsequently built models were the Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ teor@@ -@@ 3 . 
Poland 's admission to CO@@ SP@@ AR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SP@@ AR board two years later . 
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ k@@ os@@ mo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ros@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ w@@ ski became the second inter@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ kov . 
abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution . 
last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works . 
the resolution caused lively public debate . 
it will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective . 
liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the globalised world , are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition . 
its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves . 
the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation . 
due to significant labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices . 
on this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits . 
on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close down . the result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies . 
since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase . 
the whole situation is bolstered by the businessman 's complete unwillingness to pay taxes , which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit . 
the situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data . 
the ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment . 
in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards . 
this occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law . 
the aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries . 
on one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long@@ -@@ term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace . 
this yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich . 
in Germany there are already a host of food hand@@ -@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages . 
the number of these people is already in the millions . 
in the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage . 
just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag . 
the austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ sured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate as it was in the 19th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment . 
at this point we have to ask where this may come from ? 
if it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages . 
this applies to all of Latin America . 
Liberal theory and the Media incess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin . 
private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy . 
there@@ upon , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends . 
here , the answer must be yes . 
the proof is the existence of the almost omni@@ potent , and in all states , omni@@ present lobby . 
the result is a desperate situation manife@@ sting itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punishable . 
in Germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry . 
these laws are then approved in the Bundestag . 
real power does not come from the people as the W@@ ester@@ n@@ -@@ style constitutions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests . 
it is clear that liber@@ all@@ y@@ -@@ orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by A@@ pp@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Ces@@ ar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : " the State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force . 
with bribery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words . 
bribery and corruption were rife and unhindered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought " ... " people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s .. " .. " There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy , and an energetic man should be elected . " A@@ pp@@ ian had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was Ces@@ ar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently . 
the conclusion , just as in antiqu@@ ity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole . 
private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole . 
the outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms . 
the caus@@ ality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries . 
the current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an inter@@ lude , can expect its next cycle . 
the particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witnessing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history . 
the abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term . 
under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population 's living standards . 
this pattern is thus systemic . 
to address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state . 
Israel : chaos La@@ b . 
" nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , " from St@@ ing 's Fr@@ ag@@ ile , where one of the main vers@@ es from the refrain is " L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . " 
" if my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying Gu@@ tle Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ per , wife of Mayer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ s@@ child in 18@@ 49 . 
the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has sparked a lot of reaction . 
some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self@@ -@@ defence , and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs , and that Israel is a terrorist state . 
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated periodic waves of killing , on who is the transgres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today 's inhabitants of Israel , including the self@@ -@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence . 
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5@@ -@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East . 
some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history . 
human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power . 
in every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napole@@ on . 
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their thr@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre@@ -@@ calculated goal . 
we must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ udes could not happen in one generation 's lifespan . 
among these astronom@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds . 
not much is written about them . 
understandably . 
the first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high criminality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both . 
they hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either waging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of K@@ addafi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) . 
whoever attempted to defy this family died . 
A@@ bra@@ ham L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ s@@ child Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state@@ -@@ issued ) money and was assassinated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre . 
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the F@@ ed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Congres@@ sman Louis Mc@@ F@@ add@@ en was poisoned in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the F@@ ed for causing the Great De@@ pression of 1929 . 
their thirst for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the formulation of a thre@@ e@@ -@@ world@@ -@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree , Albert Pi@@ ke . 
the first war was to remove the large mon@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ um@@ en@@ ism is just an appe@@ tis@@ er for this solution ) , and finally the seizing of absolute power . 
the method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the instigation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab cha@@ o - order from chaos ) . 
these solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the F@@ ed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) . 
thus , having succeeded in assass@@ inating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Habsburg he@@ ir to the Au@@ stro@@ -@@ Hungarian thr@@ one , in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ arist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution . 
the First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , militarily and economically unsubstantiated , with German capitulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ arist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a@@ -@@ Hungary were subsequently dismantled . 
to facilitate the inception of the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by sadd@@ ling Germany with huge war reparations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the impoverished masses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi@@ -@@ racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ign@@ ited . 
at the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds instigated the establishment of the Z@@ ion@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Return to Z@@ ion ) . 
the aforementioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population . 
terrorist attacks occurred on both sides . 
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the Jewish State . 
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war reparations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hot@@ bed . 
provided the international bankers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arabic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East . 
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of discord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) . 
who is the wrong@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palest@@ ine@@ -@@ Israel conflict , where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their l@@ ust for global power ? 
here , we must differentiate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for . 
Israel 's current prime minister , Netanyahu ' the haw@@ k ' , is a typical example of a fascist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to instigate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shang@@ hai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the H@@ orm@@ u@@ z Strait , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy . 
in what light stand the words , spoken by David Roc@@ ke@@ f@@ eller in 1994 : " all we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . " 
the New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave . 
a world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aris@@ to@@ crats . 
a world , where each new@@ -@@ born is impl@@ anted with a chip , which makes their existence completely subjug@@ ated . 
" he also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name . 
if anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the be@@ ast , 
for it is man 's number . his number is six hundred and sixty six . " 
Ar@@ go : when things are at their worst - call Hollywood . 
in November 1979 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage . 
they were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Moham@@ mad Re@@ za P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades . 
for the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries . 
the release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime , could not be achieved . 
this was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force . 
the incarcerated diplomats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Algerian government . 
their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti@@ -@@ Iranian feelings at home . 
the debacle in Iran significantly influenced Jim@@ my C@@ arter 's loss with Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan in the 1980 presidential elections . 
the film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k , recoun@@ ts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory . 
just before the embassy was seized , six employees escaped . 
after some peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , they ended up in the Canadian ambassador 's residence . 
the CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -@@ fi block@@ bu@@ ster . 
a combination of gen@@ res 
the plan , conceived by " ex@@ fil@@ tration " expert , Tony M@@ ende@@ z , required the assistance of Hollywood . 
for the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fictitious production company had a real office . 
the details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony M@@ ende@@ z . 
A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k 's film is a peculiar mix of gen@@ res . 
on one hand , there is a realistic incisive political thr@@ iller , and at the same time a " cap@@ er mo@@ vi@@ e , " with small victories and doub@@ le@@ -@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean 's E@@ le@@ ven . 
the mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp docum@@ ent@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ style sequ@@ ences in Tehran ( the title sequence shows ic@@ onic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences ) . 
on the other hand , lighter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with irony and a little exaggeration . 
then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ... 
Ben A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style . 
the deri@@ ded actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments . 
Ar@@ go is his third bi@@ g@@ -@@ screen mo@@ vi@@ e , following his dark crime mo@@ vi@@ e G@@ one B@@ ab@@ y G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thr@@ iller The T@@ own ( 2010 ) . 
it is also A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's home@@ town of Bo@@ ston . 
the atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards . 
A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k shows it in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is " featured " by Canada . 
the best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn . 
a similar effect is achieved by A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k and his team in the fictitious scenes ( the fake staff at the Tehran b@@ az@@ aar ) . 
too much action in too many places 
the director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many na@@ il@@ -@@ biting scenes for the film . 
what little there is , is worked well , with some occasional embell@@ ishments to reality - these do not all come off so eleg@@ antly ( the scene , where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far@@ -@@ fetched ) . 
Ar@@ go 's weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places . 
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Good@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film . 
A@@ ff@@ lec@@ k 's film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are ev@@ oc@@ ative of thr@@ ill@@ ers from the 70 's . 
it does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate . 
as a reminder of history 's particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all@@ -@@ powerful all@@ -@@ controlling secret services , this will do . 
rules for blowing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for bananas and a circus 
the ww@@ w@@ .@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .@@ com ser@@ ver , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . " 
" we were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " Patri@@ k N@@ ach@@ er , the poll 's organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo . 
among the latest nominated absur@@ dities , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women . 
until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insurers . 
" other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year . 
the actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , " informed N@@ ach@@ er . 
among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio@@ -@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently harms the environment , the ban on reliable mercury thermom@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken cages , which significantly raised egg prices this year . 
the ban on the use of the term " spre@@ ad@@ able butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism . 
first rate bananas are to measure 14 centi@@ metres 
the Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed ) . 
the lobby 's interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 c@@ m in the EU , and were not to display and " anomalous cur@@ v@@ ature . " 
the European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmonising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading . 
norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives . 
one possible pri@@ ze@@ -@@ winner in the poll may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inf@@ late them without parental supervision . 
here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suffoc@@ ation . 
a similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers . 
strange ideas are conceived at home too 
fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the acron@@ ym FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) should be used . 
the Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .@@ com ser@@ ver in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association , La@@ is@@ sez F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the aforementioned absur@@ dities , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state . 
the EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union . 
the Czech Republic thereafter exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mush@@ room preserves , which incurred a high penalty . 
the poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding . 
these ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague . 
" we are handicapped because we do not have the sea . 
we are asking the European Union for a refund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jar@@ os@@ lav Pal@@ as ( CS@@ SD ) . 
his argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so@@ -@@ called bu@@ y@@ -@@ out interventions , the state 's ware@@ houses were full and were forced to export . 
the Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s . 
the European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea . 
funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pa@@ vel N@@ eme@@ c ( US@@ -@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels . 
EU : bizarre legislation is the exception 
regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts . 
a more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting . 
emotions flare among Czechs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed . 
the Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect the labelling of their ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c@@ ke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be renamed Tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the manufacturers . 
the appe@@ l@@ lation of rum can only be given to products dis@@ ti@@ lled from cane sugar , and not sugar beet . 
Carl@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , Po@@ ho@@ re@@ lic@@ ky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world@@ -@@ renowned fe@@ ta cheese and g@@ org@@ on@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ z@@ ip@@ an from Lu@@ beck , and Parma ham . 
the EU 's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice g@@ ing@@ erb@@ read and Hor@@ ic@@ ky tu@@ bes . 
people want me to save the republic , but I am an amateur , says O@@ k@@ am@@ ura 
Senator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ? 
this is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president . 
if everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post . 
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years , thieves roaming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing . 
I had no ambition to be a politician . 
when I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things . 
since I have already turned forty , and I am an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president . 
you have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Cast@@ le . 
are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ? 
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Cast@@ le based on the results in the Senate 's elections . 
later , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president . 
my goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised . 
therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible . 
the trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we trample anyone , who wants to try to change things . 
the Media add to this , misleading the public , and mis@@ taking freedom of speech with freedom to lie . 
for example , I was allegedly bri@@ bing reporters , or I was allegedly an advisor of J@@ iri Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k . 
let 's talk about your vision . 
you set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million . 
you need to change the law for this . 
as president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws . 
how are you going to solve this ? 
when I lobbied , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through . 
the problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public . 
as an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides . 
the advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it . 
do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ? 
from the Czech viewpoint , it seems they tend to put me to the left . 
for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right . 
the important part for me is moving forward . 
it is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together . 
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ S@@ CM or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas . 
you get angry when someone calls you a populist . 
are you not confirming this with what you have stated ? 
when you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision . 
you try to come close to it . 
some may call it populism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts . 
but without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans . 
you will not last long in politics with that . 
or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ? 
I have no alternative . 
I need to convince politicians , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through . 
if I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the At@@ torney General . 
and , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this . 
when there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene . 
take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure . 
I will say frankly that I am an amateur , I am not a genius or an intellectual . 
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision . 
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda . 
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector . 
it sounds a little like O@@ k@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic . 
I am no sa@@ viour . 
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acquain@@ tances , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate . 
I went to Rad@@ im Jan@@ cur@@ a , who declined due to his workload . 
so I , at least , support investigative journalist , J@@ ana Lo@@ ren@@ co@@ va , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil . 
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts . 
sixty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment . 
in the sen@@ ate , there are only two independ@@ ents , including me . 
people have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes . 
nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents . 
are you considering having your own party ? 
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it . 
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand . 
you have no money ? 
you are talking about financial dis@@ closures , but what is yours like ? 
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million . 
in Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apar@@ tment worth ten million , another apar@@ tment worth eight million , an ar@@ t@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ ston Martin worth 3.5 million , a Sk@@ oda Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account . 
I have the A@@ ston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James B@@ ond , who drove the car , was gall@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and villa@@ iny . 
you drive an A@@ ston Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ? 
you say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it . 
this does not inspire much confidence . 
I do not have 15 million for a campaign . 
should I take out a loan ? 
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign . 
the fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme . 
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign . 
the expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator . 
however , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month . 
if I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election . 
so you will still be in business so that you can make a living ? 
did you not say you would be putting this on hold ? 
this depends on the rate of pay . 
as I promised , my activities have been partially reduced . 
for example , my deputy is taking over as the C@@ EO of the travel agency in spring . 
people would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an , who saves the Republic . 
but I must also live off something . 
as a businessman , what would you usually make monthly ? 
two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do . 
and if I became president , then I would end my business activity . 
the full interview can be read in Saturday 's issue of Pra@@ vo . 
the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architects prove that true advent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se and the recently erected B@@ ü@@ cher@@ berg ( literally " book mountain " ) - 2 photos 
" I think the building is fun , looks fu@@ tur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , " said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g , a p@@ asser@@ -@@ by at the road@@ -@@ side . 
and Ste@@ fan Sper@@ mon , IT technic@@ ian in a major firm based nearby commented : " it 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . " 
however , I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age . 
everyone has the Internet , an i@@ P@@ ad and e@@ Books . 
no@@ -@@ one goes into one of these ol@@ d@@ -@@ style libraries voluntarily nowadays , or am I wrong ? 
Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record@@ -@@ holder . 
the 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands . 
in order to counteract this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures . 
the success of the education offensive was limited . 
and so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built ! 
W@@ iny Ma@@ as of the Rotter@@ dam@@ -@@ based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of audacious bar char@@ ts and producer of hu@@ morous and often cynical buildings , took the project on with his customary composure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face . 
and with the judging panel still looking at him with be@@ wilder@@ ment , sh@@ ru@@ gging their shoulders , the imper@@ tinent Ma@@ as st@@ acked his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words : " dear M@@ unicip@@ ality ! " 
so this is my suggestion for the Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se Book Moun@@ tain - for the so@@ -@@ called Bo@@ ek@@ enberg ! 
nine years later , the 30@@ -@@ million@@ -@@ euro mountain has been lifted up . 
it is part of a revitalisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apar@@ tment buildings and ter@@ rac@@ ed houses , with a total of 50 dwellings . 
at the beginning of November , the B@@ ü@@ cher@@ berg was awarded second place in the " B@@ est Li@@ br@@ ary of NL 2012 " competition . 
in addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wo@@ od A@@ ward 2012 . 
thus , the faceless small@@ -@@ town re@@ tor@@ t , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post@@ -@@ modern pedestrian area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ugly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture . 
first and foremost , however , Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence . 
the long journey to the book 
the first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books beneath a cheese d@@ ome . 
there is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain m@@ assi@@ f , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the to@@ po@@ graphy on foot . 
the interior space , g@@ la@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clin@@ ker flo@@ ors and the elegant street lam@@ ps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square . 
the urban ambi@@ ance is perfect . 
you are already on the loo@@ k@@ out for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football . 
and everywhere there are books , books , books . 
" normally book shelves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unpleasant and im@@ personal , " says W@@ iny Ma@@ as . 
we turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out . 
the interior of the B@@ ü@@ cher@@ berg is cleverly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room . 
one particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall c@@ lad@@ ding , par@@ ape@@ ts and rail@@ ings for the st@@ air@@ way . 
the appearance , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign . 
even di@@ e@@ -@@ hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials . 
" here we wanted to work with recyclable materials , " explained Jo@@ op T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st , Project Man@@ ager for the M@@ unicip@@ ality of Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se , on request of the Stand@@ ard . 
and thus one day we st@@ umbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm . 
for many years , milli@@ me@@ tre@@ -@@ thick artificial fabric has been used in greenh@@ ouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer . 
it is inexpensive and saves time . 
the thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste . 
for the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four@@ -@@ centi@@ me@@ tre@@ -@@ thick boards . 
under heat and pressure , the so@@ -@@ called Land@@ b@@ ou@@ w plastic ( K@@ L@@ P ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers . 
after 105 steps you have reached the summit . 
at the end of the 5@@ 00@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long journey , you are rewarded in the L@@ iter@@ ature C@@ af@@ é , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ et@@ tes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees . 
these provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air hum@@ idity in the literary mountain range . 
donations for the new soul 
" you would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a show@@ case project in the area of ecology , " said T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st . 
it is heated and co@@ oled using geothermal heat . 
although the B@@ ü@@ cher@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only shines only briefly into the interior , even on sun@@ ny days . 
the broad , lam@@ inated wood glue be@@ ams positioned at righ@@ t@@ -@@ angles to the glass fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absorb the majority of the sunlight . 
the indoor temperature is very pleasant . 
the rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blin@@ ds . 
Ste@@ fan Sper@@ mon , initially a sceptic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library . 
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g has also visited already . 
so too has T@@ CM@@ -@@ teacher , Cy@@ n@@ thia Bo@@ gar@@ de , who even refers to the Bo@@ ek@@ enberg as Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se 's " long overdue soul . " 
the reason : at the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection . 
this was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stoc@@ ked library - currently there are 7@@ 0,000 items . 
the concept has been a success . 
the shelves are full to capacity . 
" nothing is worse than a half@@ -@@ empty library , " said architect W@@ iny Ma@@ as . 
" I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building . 
everyone knows that their book is part of the building . 
even if it 's just for dec@@ oration . 
as such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ stering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity . 
Sp@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se has written literary history . 
however young and un@@ educated it may be . 
this is ultimately a starting point for identity . 
Sz@@ ab@@ o : " Germans must play a greater role " 
in the vote on the incorporation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting . 
according to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US@@ -@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line . 
Deutsche Wel@@ le : at the beginning of the week , Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for observer status within the United Nations . 
however , Berlin subsequently abstained from voting . 
why ? 
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza . 
now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cautious . 
at the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either . 
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel . 
during the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no@@ -@@ fly zone . 
this was ultimately implemented by NATO . 
does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ? 
Yes , it does . 
that is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy . 
this situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy . 
the Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts . 
it is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accustomed to . 
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a " more normal " foreign policy . 
a foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain . 
so what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy entail , from a German perspective ? 
it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners . 
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East . 
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests . 
have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ? 
on the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States . 
therefore it must be careful not to affront the public , but also the elite in the Arabic countries . 
in any case , this plays a role . 
however , I w@@ oul@@ dn 't want to ascribe too much weight to this . this is not an entirely one@@ -@@ sided relationship . 
nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's considerations . 
has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by abstaining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ? 
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prevails . 
therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fr@@ ac@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya . 
perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect . 
after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered . 
in Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative . 
the USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto . 
are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ? 
due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed . 
I think that secretly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation . 
however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly . 
it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear . 
if you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Ne@@ tan@@ j@@ ahu , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Ne@@ tan@@ j@@ ahu 's policies . 
does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ? 
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans . 
it would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy , which is currently not the case . 
thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position . 
this is precisely what they are doing with the Euro . 
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position . 
this is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel . 
this has always been a sensitive subject . 
yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role . 
does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ? 
or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ? 
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role . 
if we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti@@ -@@ German feelings become apparent . 
this does not make matters simple for the Germans . 
this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries . 
from this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA . 
it must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy . 
the influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ? 
the Germans will simply have to play a greater role . 
even if they do not like it , even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c '@@ est la vi@@ e !

" brand protection " in China : when P@@ uma and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese 
Ar@@ man@@ i is a world@@ -@@ famous brand , Polo R@@ al@@ ph Lau@@ ren likewise . 
however , what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ? 
behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies . 
nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual creators of the names do not su@@ e . 
and even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights . 
" it is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , " said Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ essing law firm , who speci@@ alises in copyright infringement in the Far East . 
every week a new case lands on my desk . 
all the cop@@ yc@@ ats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands . 
thus Guc@@ ci simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Guc@@ ci , P@@ rad@@ a@@ -@@ K@@ ny is registered in place of P@@ rad@@ a . 
German companies are also ' legally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting app@@ are@@ l , P@@ uma . 
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking . 
on 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copy@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Ze@@ gna DF P@@ uma there , an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Ze@@ gna . 
the fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well@@ -@@ known . 
in the major cities there are multi@@ -@@ level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively . 
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere . 
the Chinese call this " Ban@@ g M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , " a passenger brand . 
the word is based on " Ban@@ g Dak@@ uan . " 
this refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men . 
the Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing . 
" this harms business and we must fight against it , " challenges P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch . 
" the brand is watered down , its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous . " 
the financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products . 
according to information from market research company C@@ L@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing . 
however , the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny . 
the process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome . 
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch reports of instances whereby the court dismis@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a " market reality . " 
if the complainant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pl@@ ag@@ i@@ arist money for having infringed on his trademark in China , said P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch . 
sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here . 
famous cases also relate to graphic elements . 
in 2009 , D@@ aim@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer P@@ utz@@ me@@ ister . 
even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emb@@ lem that resembles the Mercedes star . 
Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purchaser Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that resemb@@ led the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbitr@@ ated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it . 
fashion house L@@ ac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against cop@@ yc@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction . 
the Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing . 
the C@@ T@@ M@@ O trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment . 
in the past year , however , things reportedly " returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . " 
thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent . 
almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year . 
nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office . 
to remedy this is very expensive 
as is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing . 
in the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the C@@ T@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 . 
this is a record and means that China , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority . 
the same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , totalling 5.5 million in number . 
in 2011 , 1.8 billion y@@ uan in fees were received . 
put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 280 y@@ uan , or 160 euros . 
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ ud@@ enberg . 
for more than seven years , the group has been contesting against a Chinese pl@@ ag@@ i@@ arist . 
the Germans did in fact manage to expose the company 's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts . 
however , the cop@@ yc@@ at still secured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg brand . 
this is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Han@@ no W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ ud@@ enberg Chem@@ ical Speci@@ alities in Munich . 
the C@@ T@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dismissed the M@@ unic@@ h@@ -@@ based company 's appeal . 
in the next two instances , Fre@@ ud@@ enberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day . 
you have to pay extremely careful attention . 
the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court . 
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts . 
however , he also says : " the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and nerves . " 
the internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through cent@@ ur@@ y@@ -@@ old records in order to provide proof . 
five years ago Fre@@ ud@@ enberg un@@ successfully offered the opposing party a " high six@@ -@@ figure sum in euros " as settlement . 
" this shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler . 
the dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe . 
particularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure unprotected brand names there . 
for example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg label for shoes and leather in Germany . 
this is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration . 
" you have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler . 
both he and P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China . 
it is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register " everything " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler . 
otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee . 
in actual fact : if Fre@@ ud@@ enberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler . 
or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector . 
World AIDS day : St@@ om@@ p , sing , help 
in Hei@@ del@@ berg , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir is rehear@@ sing - and in the Swa@@ z@@ iland , AIDS orphans are delighted . 
the history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres . 
first of all , the stamping : C@@ ow@@ boy boo@@ ts , bas@@ ket@@ ball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that . 
one@@ -@@ two@@ -@@ thre@@ e@@ -@@ four . 
only then do the voices of the sing@@ ers slowly swell - al@@ to , bas@@ s , tenor and sop@@ ran@@ o surge , be@@ gu@@ ile and haunt . 
and Fi@@ ete Hop@@ f , the 2@@ 9@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old conduc@@ tor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ens@@ emb@@ le together with his smooth , yet wild gestures . 
it is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy in Hei@@ del@@ berg the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i C@@ ho@@ ir are practising a new song . 
the fifteen sing@@ ers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tic@@ ists to the maintenance man . 
" O@@ m '@@ O@@ ban@@ i " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Z@@ ul@@ u , which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Mal@@ awi , Mozambique and in parts of Swa@@ z@@ iland . 
helping others to help themselves 
there are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the esti@@ mations of U@@ NA@@ I@@ DS , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS . 
of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa . 
in Swa@@ z@@ iland , there are 2@@ 4@@ 5@@ ,000 AIDS orphans . 
meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive . 
the Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i . 
70 of these attend a secondary school . 
for 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a sponsor . 
this guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Go@@ go Centre . 
in Z@@ ul@@ u , Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i means stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er or wor@@ ship@@ per . 
in this region , no@@ -@@ one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it . 
for almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been practising songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa . 
for an 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilometre flight away from Hei@@ del@@ berg , in the north west of the Swa@@ z@@ iland Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i , which relies on the vocal power of the German cho@@ ir . 
forty percent are infected . 
around 2@@ ,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw hu@@ ts , and the majority of them are children . 
more than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succumbed to the HIV virus . 
in E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i you get a small fores@@ ha@@ dow of the illness from which all of Swa@@ z@@ iland is suffering : according to Un@@ ic@@ ef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world . 
circumcision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely practised by the population . 
more than forty percent of people in the Swa@@ z@@ iland carry the immu@@ no@@ deficiency virus , and dying in you mid@@ -@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare . 
on a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the C@@ ho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education . 
without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country . 
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year . 
however , just one year later , the cho@@ ir established the " Vo@@ ices for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i at an almost professional level . 
facts on sexually transmitted infections . 
what are the most important sexually transmitted diseases ? 
bac@@ terial ST@@ Is include sy@@ phil@@ is , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and g@@ on@@ or@@ rho@@ ea . 
common viral ST@@ Is are HIV , human p@@ ap@@ ill@@ om@@ a viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ it@@ alis and hepatitis . 
cr@@ abs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ Is . 
who are the main affected groups ? 
sy@@ phil@@ is and g@@ on@@ or@@ rho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men . 
the Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all sy@@ phil@@ is cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men . 
among heterosex@@ ual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections , tric@@ hom@@ oni@@ asis , candi@@ di@@ asis ( fun@@ gal ) , g@@ on@@ or@@ rho@@ ea and human p@@ ap@@ ill@@ om@@ a viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases . 
the spread of HIV among heterosex@@ ual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group . 
among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections are much more common than in other population groups . 
according to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 . 
in this country , human p@@ ap@@ ill@@ om@@ a viruses are also frequently found in young people . 
how has the number of infections developed ? 
not all sexually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable . 
according to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of sy@@ phil@@ is infections has more than doubled from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 . 
the number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 . 
in 2011 there were around 2@@ ,@@ 700 cases . 
this is around one tenth fewer than the previous year . 
which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease ? 
the infectious diseases can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the genital area , dis@@ comfort when ur@@ inating , discharge , lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and b@@ lis@@ ters or war@@ ts . 
however , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining unde@@ tec@@ ted . 
how can you protect yourself ? 
condoms can reduce the risk of contraction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection . 
this is because occasionally , the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infections and close bo@@ dily contact . 
therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations . 
if diagnosed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be cured and long@@ -@@ term consequences avoided . 
through spon@@ sor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up . 
" in total , we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i , " said An@@ net@@ te Len@@ nar@@ tz , Chairperson of the association . 
in the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self@@ -@@ assured and assertive woman , manages the money from Germany . 
she makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation , for example with one of their grand@@ mothers . 
the Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Z@@ ul@@ u , are the pillars of the village . 
some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punc@@ tually every day , in their school uniforms . 
anyone who doesn 't have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with Kh@@ any@@ is@@ ile , a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two coo@@ ks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day . 
in addition , " Vo@@ ices for Africa " has established a se@@ wing school , built two chicken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , PS@@ I , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV . 
this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wrap@@ s is if people are dead . 
a king with 14 wives 
" AIDS is an absolute taboo subject , " said An@@ net@@ te Len@@ nar@@ tz , " because it is associated with sexuality . " 
this is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives . 
the last absolute mon@@ arch of sub@@ -@@ Saharan Africa , King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle . 
polygam@@ y in place of democracy . 
among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle . 
another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country . 
there are free condoms on every corner , said An@@ net@@ te Len@@ nar@@ tz , " but they are hardly used . 
the culture prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh . " 
in order to promote the cultural exchange , the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ ancho@@ ly , fighting spirit , confidence and black self@@ -@@ esteem , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid . 
a bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some gri@@ m@@ -@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few tears . 
the journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i , where the sing@@ ers visit their sponsor children . 
even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well@@ -@@ known in the valley of the E@@ z@@ ul@@ w@@ en@@ i River . 
" go to E@@ sit@@ j@@ en@@ i , that 's where the light is , " say the people there . 
and if you make the 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilometre flight back to Hei@@ del@@ berg , to visit the stom@@ ping sing@@ ers in their rehear@@ sal room , you 'll see that the light is there too . 
messenger : NA@@ SA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cury 
the Mess@@ enger pro@@ be has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury . 
it is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick . 
the US space agency , NA@@ SA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury . 
although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine " Science . " 
the Mess@@ enger pro@@ be has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow . 
this is thought to be at east 30 centi@@ metres and perhaps up to 20 metres thick . 
the water presumably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that impacted with Mer@@ cury . 
however , no@@ -@@ one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scienti@@ st for the Mess@@ enger pro@@ be , S@@ ean Solomon . 
the temperature on Mer@@ cury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Cel@@ sius . 
that said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system . 
unknown to the majority of the Earth 's inhabitants , there are prob@@ es , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and small ro@@ bo@@ ts such as the P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , deployed to research the depths of the universe . 
from time to time , they transmit images to Earth : small pe@@ ep@@ holes into the infinite expan@@ se . 
this image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Ma@@ x Plan@@ ck Institute . 
the eight plan@@ ets of our solar system , plus the dwarf planet Ce@@ res . 
like P@@ lu@@ to , which or@@ bits around the sun behind Nep@@ tune , Ce@@ res is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Union in 2006 . 
this image section from an infra@@ red recording by the Sp@@ itz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shows a " family por@@ tra@@ it " of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue do@@ ts , while more difficult to identify are the p@@ ink@@ -@@ coloured " new@@ -@@ bor@@ ns " in the star delivery room . 
this star@@ -@@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Sp@@ itz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope in the C@@ assi@@ o@@ pe@@ ia constell@@ ation , at a distance of 6@@ ,@@ 500 light years away . 
this sh@@ imm@@ ering g@@ low of a dying star was captured by NA@@ SA 's Sp@@ itz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope . 
the don@@ ut@@ -@@ shaped ring consists of material , e@@ jec@@ ted by the star in the process of dying . 
in the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d Ne@@ bul@@ a , 5@@ ,@@ 400 light years away from the Earth , new stars are created from gas and dust . 
NA@@ SA 's Sp@@ itz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shot this photo of the gal@@ ac@@ tic delivery room . 
the Ple@@ i@@ ades star cluster , also referred to as " The S@@ even S@@ isters , " can be seen with the bare eye at night . 
with the tel@@ es@@ cope , however , the colours really come into their own . 
in this infra@@ red photo , the He@@ lix Ne@@ bul@@ a looks back at the observer like a red eye . 
it is located 700 light years away in the A@@ qu@@ ari@@ us constell@@ ation . 
its similarity with the continent resulted in this Ne@@ bul@@ a acquiring the title ' North America ' . 
a combination of normal and infra@@ red photograp@@ hy produced the spectacular col@@ ouring . 
this baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Sp@@ itz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope 's infra@@ red detec@@ tors . 
Satur@@ n and its rings : how these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astronom@@ y . 
perhaps they are the remnants of a moon of Satur@@ n , which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago . 
one of the largest and shar@@ pest pictures from the H@@ ub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope : the W@@ hi@@ r@@ l@@ pool Gal@@ ax@@ y 
depending on the col@@ ouring , photographs of spiral gal@@ ax@@ ies can become genuine works of art . 
the photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d Ne@@ bul@@ a in the S@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us constell@@ ation , several thousand light years away . 
the name Tri@@ fi@@ d stems from the Latin word tri@@ fid@@ us ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stri@@ pes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts . 
in the Op@@ hi@@ uc@@ hus constell@@ ation , astronom@@ ers have photograp@@ h@@ ed the signs of a co@@ sm@@ ic collision : 400 million light years from the earth , the co@@ res of two merging gal@@ ax@@ ies move rapidly towards one another , destined to colli@@ de . 
this star birth was captured by the H@@ ub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope in the M@@ 83 spiral gal@@ ax@@ y . 
anyone who doesn 't like technical abbrevi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its nic@@ k@@ name , the Southern Catherine W@@ heel . 
the photo taken by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope shows a section of the Ir@@ is Ne@@ bul@@ a in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us constell@@ ation . 
the ne@@ bul@@ a , 1,@@ 400 light years away , consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust . 
this image was put together from the X@@ -@@ ray images captured by various tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es . 
it shows a ring of black holes , 4@@ 30 million light years away from the Earth . 
this group of gal@@ ax@@ ies , named Ar@@ p 2@@ 73 , was pic@@ tured for NA@@ SA by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
scientists call the larger spiral gal@@ ax@@ y U@@ G@@ C 18@@ 10 . 
this star ne@@ bul@@ a is home to the brigh@@ test group of young stars in our Mil@@ ky W@@ ay . 
this ' star cradle ' continually produces new youngsters . 
likewise , this star cloud , connected to the Ro@@ set@@ te Ne@@ bul@@ a , continually produces new baby stars - 5@@ 000 light years away from the Earth . 
in this bright shining gal@@ ax@@ y with one small black hole , there exists no dust - only gas . 
researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Ban@@ g , when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen . 
our view of the universe : the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es 
the tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have been invented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Lip@@ per@@ he@@ y - even before Galileo Galil@@ ei used the device to observe the stars one year later . 
since then , the mirrors in optical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound . 
for a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Observatory near San Di@@ e@@ go was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world . 
the mirror , shown in the image , had a diame@@ ter of five metres . 
Ari@@ z@@ ona , USA , is home to the Lar@@ ge B@@ inoc@@ ular Tel@@ es@@ cope . 
it enables views of space via two mirrors , each with a diame@@ ter of 8.4 metres . 
the inner workings of the Gr@@ an Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island of La Pal@@ ma are huge - the mirror alone has a diame@@ ter of 10.@@ 4 metres . 
the mirror of the Southern African Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs . 
in spite of this it achieves a diame@@ ter of around eleven metres . 
the disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method : the tel@@ es@@ cope is securely cl@@ amped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited . 
the H@@ obby E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination . 
what sets it apart : the high ligh@@ t@@ -@@ gathering capacity . 
this - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diame@@ ter - even matches that of the world 's largest reflec@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es . 
with the help of a radio tel@@ es@@ cope in A@@ reci@@ bo ( Puer@@ to R@@ ico ) researchers can listen for extr@@ ater@@ re@@ strial signals in space . 
the radio tel@@ es@@ cope has a diame@@ ter of 3@@ 05 metres . 
in the " S@@ earch for Ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ re@@ strial Intel@@ ligence " ( S@@ ET@@ I ) every computer owner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available . 
view of the European Southern Observatory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chilean An@@ des . 
this is home to the Ver@@ y Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope , which lives up to its name . 
with its total of four mirrors , the tel@@ es@@ cope can also focus on the medi@@ al infra@@ red spectrum . 
likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Observatory in Chile , the European Ex@@ tre@@ mely Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being planned . 
its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1@@ ,000 mirror elements . 
however , images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest . 
until 2007 , the two K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the H@@ aw@@ ai@@ ian volcano , Ma@@ una K@@ ea , were the largest in the world . 
they each have two mirrors , each with a diame@@ ter of ten meters . 
the K@@ eck Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una K@@ ea Observatory , which alongside the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heavens with the help of the Sub@@ ar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the I@@ RT@@ T@@ F . 
another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una K@@ ea , with a mirror diame@@ ter of thirty metres . 
here you can mar@@ vel at an artist 's impression . 
however , the most important insights into space are provided by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds . 
since March 2009 the Ke@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope has been searching for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be inhabitable . 
on 2 February 2011 it was announced by NA@@ SA that 1,@@ 235 plan@@ etary candidates had been identified since the mission began . 
the image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope . 
the James We@@ b@@ b Space Tel@@ es@@ cope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ an@@ e@@ 5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest . 
the primary mirror of the infra@@ red space tel@@ es@@ cope has a diame@@ ter of 6.5 metres . 
one of the tel@@ es@@ cope 's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and gal@@ ax@@ ies that emerged after the Big Ban@@ g . 
scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cury 's south pole . 
however , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Mess@@ enger or@@ bits around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north pole . 
for decades , radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cury . 
thanks to the Mess@@ enger pro@@ be that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mer@@ cury , scientists can now be certain . 
drink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age 
in Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach biblical ages . 
there is even a museum of long@@ ev@@ ity . 
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young . 
in Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical . 
there is even a museum of long@@ ev@@ ity . 
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young . 
the journey through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic . 
the mini@@ bus r@@ umb@@ les over the winding streets , past densely woo@@ ded hills , raging rivers and simple farm@@ houses . 
everywhere is green and lus@@ h - you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest . 
however , this is the deep south of Azerbaijan , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away . 
this is the home of the Caucasian people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azer@@ i and live long lives . 
the final stop is L@@ er@@ ik . 
the small town is bursting with over@@ powering architecture from Soviet times , which doesn 't fit with the pic@@ tu@@ res@@ que mountain landscape at all . 
tourists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azerbaijan 's capital city , Baku , is too arduous . 
it takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track . 
the fab@@ ulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank , has not yet arrives here in the province . 
yet pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ er@@ ik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction . 
" Baku became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , " said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva . 
she is the Director of the Museum of L@@ ong@@ ev@@ ity , most likely the only of its kind in the world . 
here the lives of eight dozen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black & white photo . 
this here is my grandfather , he was 120 years old . 
at the age of 136 he fa@@ thered another child . 
however , the un@@ rivalled star of the museum is shep@@ herd Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 168 years old . 
however no birth certificate exists to confirm this . 
and given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age , Musli@@ mo@@ v 's claim seems extremely doubtful . 
" he was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , " explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva . 
the man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ thered another daughter at the age of 136 . 
so did Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ? 
but R@@ emb@@ ran@@ dt Sch@@ ol@@ z , researcher on ageing at the Ma@@ x Plan@@ ck Institute in Ro@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia . 
" a stri@@ kingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the H@@ un@@ za Valley in Pakistan , " said Sch@@ ol@@ z , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in S@@ ard@@ inia . " 
due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth registers . 
mel@@ ted butter by the glass , every day 
however , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ er@@ ik reach a biblical age with striking regularity . 
there are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age . 
so why do so many very old people live here in the south ? 
the Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ arid Mu@@ g@@ im@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh genetics . 
in contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet . 
however the notion that the cal@@ ori@@ e@@ -@@ rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of mel@@ ted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either . 
or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? in C@@ eng@@ em@@ ir@@ an , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ er@@ ik , lives R@@ ub@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva . 
at 97 years old she is still comparatively young for the area . 
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region . 
she sits on the floor with a butter chur@@ n , which she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly . 
eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time . 
there are also two small children running around . 
in the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , b@@ ulg@@ ing Ar@@ mad@@ u glasses . 
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her headscar@@ f she conceals long , dark bl@@ ond pla@@ its , which her son proudly reveals for us . 
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour . 
" I have never used sham@@ po@@ o either , " said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva . 
monthly pension is enough to live on 
she has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes , potatoes , peas . 
my whole life I have never once bought g@@ roc@@ eries in the supermarket . 
then she tells of her husband who was in the army . 
things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War . 
however , everything became better when the " beloved father " He@@ y@@ dar Aliyev took the rud@@ der . 
the propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady . 
yet the cult that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan . 
he held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm . 
at least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijan 's elderly . 
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably . 
and perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva 's long gre@@ ying son is right : " the elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . " 
they live among their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy . 
if this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ? 
the notion of " human rights " is omitted from the constitution . 
the revolution has returned to Cairo . 
competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country . 
the future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed . 
the Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion . 
we must make the transition . 
" and making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , " he said on state television . 
his speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Coptic Christians , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secul@@ ar@@ ists . 
for all of them , until now hopelessly e@@ strang@@ ed in a bewil@@ dered opposition , are fearful . 
they are fearful of a God State on the N@@ ile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood . 
according to Mohamed M@@ urs@@ i , speaking almost apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , " in order to rescue the revolution . " 
however , Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old engineer who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save . 
should the judiciary be deprived of power ? 
in actual fact , the 2@@ 34 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic@@ -@@ dominated 1@@ 10@@ -@@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern . 
as was also the case under previous constitutions , under the draft judic@@ ature is justified on the " principles of Islamic law . " 
yet what are " principles " ? 
this was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law . 
this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sharia law , the Al A@@ sha@@ r University must be consulted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam . 
this can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation , which would result in the de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judiciary . 
much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation 
also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld . 
during Mubarak 's rule , these courts served to suppress opposition . 
following the fall of the dictator , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military imprisonment . 
according to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its morals and values . " 
from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinem@@ atic art and literature . 
in plain language , this is nothing other than censorship . 
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women . 
another does prohibit the insult or slander of the proph@@ et Mohamed and his emis@@ s@@ aries . 
however , what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear . 
equally dubious is the formulation stating that " insulting people " is forbidden . 
is a caricature of the president sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ? 
open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by M@@ urs@@ i to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyptians for referendum " very soon . " 
" the revolution is back " 
for weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists . 
tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square in Cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect . 
" the revolution is back and we are going to be victorious , " said Ham@@ din Sab@@ ba@@ hi , third place candidate in the presidential elections . 
noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed El@@ -@@ Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs " on the rubbish tip of history . " 
via SMS service Twitter , he accused M@@ urs@@ i 's followers of wanting to lead " a coup against democracy . " 
" if he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and overthrow him , " said member of the opposition J@@ ass@@ er S@@ aid . 
" we have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been at@@ oned for , " stated the Egyptian media , quoting opposition politician Ch@@ aled Ali . 
and several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum , which would render it invalid . 
" the Koran is our constitution " 
the well@@ -@@ organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter@@ -@@ demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the N@@ ile , outside the Cairo University . 
many veiled women and followers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , shouting out : " the people demand the application of God 's law . " 
they demanded of M@@ urs@@ i : " clean@@ se the country ! " and protested : " the Koran is our constitution . " 
a struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war . 
quite clearly , this was something that M@@ urs@@ i 's followers did not want to risk . 
the Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear . 
now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box , in which direction the country should move forward . 
it is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists ' draft . 
" the term ' human rights ' does not even appear once " 
Ha@@ fe@@ z Abu Sa@@ eda is furious about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups . 
the 4@@ 8@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( EO@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood , when imprisoned or in court under Mubarak . 
not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indivisible . 
for this he was battered , condemned and imprisoned . 
" and now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he bemo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with " Wel@@ t am S@@ on@@ n@@ tag . " 
the lawyer has resigned himself to M@@ urs@@ i extending his power to all three branches of state government . 
these measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship . 
" instead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspending it , " complained Sa@@ eda . 
yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function . 
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the N@@ ile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement . 
this could come back to haunt them . 
one demonstr@@ ator at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r warned : " you are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . " 
Norway 's rak@@ fis@@ k : is this the world 's sm@@ el@@ li@@ est fish ? 
Norway 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world . 
could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly sm@@ elly fish ? 
take a selection of over@@ -@@ ripe che@@ es@@ es . 
place them in the midst of a pile of dirty , wet so@@ cc@@ er kit . 
leave for a week . 
now you have the no@@ se@@ -@@ num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwegian delic@@ acies . 
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , about three hours from Oslo . 
there is snow , spectacular sc@@ ener@@ y - and that od@@ our , ever present , hangs in the air . 
rak@@ fis@@ k is tr@@ out s@@ prin@@ k@@ led with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year . 
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwegians f@@ lock to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods . 
" you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , " says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , ful@@ l@@ -@@ time local fire@@ fighter but also the so@@ -@@ called " R@@ ak@@ fis@@ k General , " in charge of running the festival . 
all around us people are eating little cu@@ bes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink . 
" some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , " says Hav@@ ard . 
the drink can kill the smell . 
I try a few pieces . 
if you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of su@@ sh@@ i that has been on rather a long bus journey . 
rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken times in Norway when , pre@@ -@@ refrigeration , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autumn . 
then in the depths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten . 
only a generation ago , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work , emi@@ grating mainly to the US . 
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by plentiful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system . 
people from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work . 
rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ elly part of Norway 's past . 
it is among the more expensive dishes you can buy . 
but then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sand@@ wich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each . 
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way . 
people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name An@@ ders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the righ@@ t@@ -@@ wing , racist extremist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year . 
instead , the sho@@ o@@ tings are referred to as " the July the 22@@ nd incident . " 
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace@@ -@@ loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder . 
the growth since the early 1970s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway 's pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day wealth . 
" but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , handing round tr@@ ays of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ ond hair and start@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well@@ -@@ being . 
we are a - how you say - prudent people . 
her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ lawless . 
we are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation . 
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations . 
when everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound . 
" as long as we can ski in winter and go hi@@ king in summer we are happy , " says Anna . 
" and eat rak@@ fis@@ k , " she adds with a care@@ free laugh . 
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k . 
now an el@@ k bur@@ ger is certainly something different and rather succ@@ ul@@ ent to the taste . 
but in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ elly fish . 
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish . 
there is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k . 
it is like the Euro@@ vision song contest . 
" what score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Thor@@ -@@ Ju@@ erg@@ en ? " 
" here are our points , Hav@@ ard . " 
there is cl@@ apping , laughter . 
a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it . 
or maybe it is the fumes from all that fish . 
Mexico 's Enrique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to faces tough start 
as Mexico 's incoming President Enrique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to prepares to take office , the BBC 's W@@ ill G@@ rant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population . 
traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present . 
a congested city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads . 
the aim , however , was@@ n 't to stop commu@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament . 
on Saturday , Mexico 's new president Enrique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation . 
he faces a complicated task . 
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 6@@ 0,000 lives in six years . 
" my government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , " Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week . 
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim . 
before rub@@ bing shoulders with the US president , Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico . 
a populous , sp@@ raw@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stom@@ ping ground . 
a straightforward man 
in the bu@@ co@@ lic town of Valle del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remembered fon@@ dly . 
residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure . 
to reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to 's new motorways , a vast improvement on the cr@@ acked and bu@@ mp@@ y roads it replaced . 
pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change . 
" we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ vera Her@@ nan@@ dez , a state cong@@ res@@ sman for Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to 's party , the PR@@ I . 
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs . 
after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ousted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fox . 
Congres@@ sman Ol@@ vera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of L@@ os P@@ inos , there is much expectation within the party about Enrique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to . 
and he rejects the opposition 's character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance . 
he 's a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country . 
he 's an excellent statesman and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen . 
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor . 
in Ne@@ z@@ a@@ hu@@ alco@@ yo@@ t@@ l , also known as Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ne@@ za , the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bra@@ vo cou@@ l@@ dn 't be sharper . 
t@@ ucked away under motorway fl@@ yo@@ vers , it is in many ways a subur@@ b of Mexico City itself . 
and the problems in the municipality are also gr@@ it@@ ty and urban . 
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods , and violence against women is particularly acute . 
on a patch of wast@@ eland by a vast landfill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone . 
more than 1@@ ,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women . 
Mr Pen@@ a Nie@@ to 's critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ icide while he was in office . 
at worst , they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye . 
in a concrete home typical of the r@@ und@@ own neighbourhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Buen@@ dia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una . 
according to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 . 
however her family believes she was murdered by her partner . 
" when I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , " Sen@@ ora Buen@@ dia recalls . 
there were signs she '@@ d been beaten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in . 
as her mother recoun@@ ts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice . 
however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied . 
the state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old go@@ ssi@@ p , a troub@@ le@@ -@@ maker , a wh@@ in@@ er . 
what they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shu@@ ts up . 
" but that can 't be right when there were so many irregularities and omissions , " she says . 
as President Pen@@ a Nie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility . 
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office . 
" I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , " says PR@@ I Congres@@ sman Ol@@ vera in Valle del Bra@@ vo . 
that , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ne@@ za most fear . 
Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning didn 't complain about mistreatment , prosecutors contend 
prosecutors try to counter Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning 's claims of abuse in confinement 
the hearing focuses on Man@@ ning 's time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Virg@@ inia 
def@@ ense wants case dismissed on grounds that Man@@ ning 's confinement was harsh 
the Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents 
prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he 's alleg@@ ing he suffered in military custody . 
while cross@@ -@@ examining Man@@ ning at a pre@@ -@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosecutor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den Fe@@ in asserted that records of weekly visits Man@@ ning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Virg@@ inia , show no complaints about his treatment . 
the cross@@ -@@ examination -- during a hearing on a def@@ ense motion to have Man@@ ning 's case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Man@@ ning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody . 
the Army intelligence analy@@ st , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq . 
the material was then published online by WikiLeaks . 
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Man@@ ning was the source of its information . 
in Friday 's hearing , Fe@@ in reviewed with Man@@ ning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Man@@ ning during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011 . 
officers would ask Man@@ ning questions and write down his responses . 
when Fe@@ in asked about the forms Friday , Man@@ ning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . " 
the forms show no complaints of mistreatment , even though the officers asked Man@@ ning directly about his treatment , Fe@@ in cont@@ ended . 
Man@@ ning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn 't record the issues . 
" they would write down ' no issues ' ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn 't necessarily mean I didn 't bring something up , " Man@@ ning said . 
the judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise L@@ ind , also asked Man@@ ning why he didn 't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier . 
Man@@ ning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injury " status downgraded . 
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others . 
" I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , " Man@@ ning said . 
Man@@ ning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in Virg@@ inia in July 2010 . 
he said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat . 
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distressing . 
" my world just shrink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ jon , to that cage , " Man@@ ning said Thursday . 
I thought I was going to die in that cage . 
once at Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Man@@ ning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company . 
Man@@ ning said he was allowed only a mat@@ tress , blanket , fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops , some clothes and his glasses . 
he said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules . 
Man@@ ning said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his eyes . 
if guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over . 
Man@@ ning 's lawyer filed a formal objection to Man@@ ning 's treatment in January 2011 . 
Man@@ ning was moved to the military prison at For@@ t Le@@ aven@@ worth , K@@ ans@@ as , in April 2011 . 
also Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ning about an allegation that he made in Thursday 's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o cell , he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count . 
Man@@ ning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count . 
under questioning from the judge Friday , Man@@ ning said that he inferred from his guard 's order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it . 
Man@@ ning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he was@@ n 't a danger to himself . 
Man@@ ning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops to hurt himself but ha@@ dn 't done so . 
that night , Man@@ ning testified , his under@@ wear , fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ ops and glasses were removed from his cell . 
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his cour@@ t@@ -@@ martial , which is expected to begin early next year . 
the def@@ ense has said it plans to have Man@@ ning plead guilty to lesser off@@ en@@ ses and fight other charges as being too extreme . 
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted . 
the Pentagon has maintained that Man@@ ning was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um@@ -@@ custody detainees at Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o . 
counts against Man@@ ning include aiding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , transmitting national def@@ ense information and theft of public property or records . 
if he 's convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence . 
my Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American identity crisis 
he says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there 
Mex@@ icans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ icans of hard times , he says 
Nav@@ arre@@ tte says Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans are caught between two worlds 
on a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the conc@@ our@@ se and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ umped . 
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ os " ( " Mex@@ icans " ) , another for " Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os " ( " Fo@@ reign@@ ers . " ) 
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go . 
growing up in Central California , I had been called a " Mexican " my entire life . 
it 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Bo@@ ston refer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . " 
later , I settled on " Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American . " 
but , this was Mexico . 
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens . 
I was simply an American . 
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language . 
but I don 't have the vocabulary of a native , and I can 't shake my American accent . 
so I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os . 
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican presid@@ ent@@ -@@ elect Enrique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama . 
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade . 
Pen@@ a Nie@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ icans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States . 
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union@@ -@@ style trading bloc in North America . 
and Pen@@ a Nie@@ to v@@ owed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug cartels , even though he offered no specifics . 
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings . 
most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of ri@@ f@@ le . 
but for Mex@@ icans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the reminders are everywhere . 
so the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are encro@@ aching upon their nei@@ gh@@ b@@ or 's sovereignty . 
and the children of Mon@@ te@@ z@@ uma go on the war@@ path . 
and yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans living in the United States . 
you want to talk about hard feelings ? 
there is plenty . 
Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn 't . 
the only reason you have so many people of Mexican anc@@ e@@ stry living in cities like L@@ os Angel@@ es , L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as , P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north . 
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc . 
we 're their offspring , and we 're loyal to them . 
not Mexico . 
and even though we may now be living the American D@@ re@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American D@@ re@@ am we 're living , and not the Mexican one . 
our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zz@@ y , but our loyalty is clear . 
it 's to the United States . 
besides , we 're aware that many of the elite Mex@@ icans in the ruling class don 't like us . 
the feeling is mutual . 
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isn 't sufficiently Mexican . 
our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough . 
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure . 
if our families ha@@ dn 't failed in Mexico , they w@@ oul@@ dn 't have left . 
and we w@@ oul@@ dn 't now find ourselves trapped behind the sil@@ k curtain , living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless . 
my wife , who was born in Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between Mex@@ icans and Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans because Mex@@ icans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans resent that . 
while she 's a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries . 
meanwhile , many Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either . 
we love listening to the Mexican band , L@@ os T@@ ig@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bru@@ ce S@@ pr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en . 
you get the best of both worlds , but you 're rooted in neither . 
in Mexico , we 're seen as Americans . 
and in the United States , we 're considered Mexican . 
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelli@@ gent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a . 
they want to put Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans to work as makeshift " ambassadors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States . 
we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico . 
Y@@ e@@ ah . 
that 's not going to happen . 
too many hard feelings . 
and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country . 
I 'm afraid you 're on your own , ami@@ gos . 
that 's fair . 
if at least some Mex@@ icans are@@ n 't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans still hold a grud@@ ge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that . 
H@@ m@@ mm . 
maybe we 're more " Mexican " than I thought . 
old battles , new Middle East 
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace 
can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ? 
another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain . 
amid the usual futile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel 's metro@@ polis , and the holy city of Jerusalem . 
but though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing . 
the Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil . 
maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ di@@ er than before . 
however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate . 
a war that is neither lost or won 
at first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now . 
even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the haw@@ ks on both sides . 
the leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing . 
despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaza 's 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas . 
indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction . 
moreover , Hamas 's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side . 
as Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends . 
Turkey , a resur@@ gent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states . 
jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islamist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hiz@@ bul@@ lah par@@ ty@@ -@@ cum@@ -@@ militia holds sway , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may top@@ ple Bas@@ har Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are men@@ acing the king . 
above all , on Israel 's southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance . 
H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak , the secular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas . 
by contrast , the Brotherhood is a cous@@ in of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion . 
in future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America . 
meanwhile , Israel 's hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conclusions . 
in military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box . 
Israel 's Iron D@@ ome anti@@ -@@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missiles have been destroyed . 
Israelis will sleep more soundly - for a while . 
in diplomatic terms , America is as steadfast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence . 
above all , Israel has pro@@ spe@@ red , especially under B@@ in@@ y@@ am@@ in Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process . 
although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suic@@ ide@@ -@@ bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ unk of a w@@ oul@@ d@@ -@@ be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law . 
Mr Netanyahu , whose Li@@ k@@ ud party has merged with an even more haw@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ man in the run@@ -@@ up to an election on January 22@@ nd , is sitting pretty . 
why cod@@ dle those tw@@ is@@ ty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ? 
if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in Gaza ? 
better to keep them behind that wall and sm@@ ite them if they raise their heads . 
maybe the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations . 
even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home . 
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined . 
starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments m@@ end their economies . 
that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark the start of something . 
Israelis too should look to the longer term . 
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving Palestinians of their right to self@@ -@@ determination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week . 
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population s@@ wells . 
bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll . 
both sides need pro@@ dding by outsiders 
the answer remains the one trumpe@@ ted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel c@@ eding territory for security . 
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause . 
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem . 
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together . 
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the UN . 
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table . 
during his first term , he neglected to present his own plan for peace . 
back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in . 
this is woefully short@@ -@@ sighted . 
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East . 
that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians . 
cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia 
smoking warnings and dise@@ ased body parts emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands 
Australia 's world@@ -@@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green co@@ ver@@ ings , gruesome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking . 
apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small fon@@ t . 
it is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco . 
Australia 's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of g@@ lam@@ our . 
it is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up . 
" even from a very early age you can see that ki@@ ds understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , " said the federal health minister , T@@ any@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a pr@@ inc@@ ess . 
while Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps . 
the tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws . 
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes . 
" there will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation , " said Scott McIn@@ tyre of British American Tobacco Australia . 
counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia . 
others say the laws have boosted their business . 
Sand@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Im@@ port P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , si@@ lic@@ on covers to mask the un@@ palatable packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco , Britain 's Im@@ peri@@ al Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court . 
ha said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6@@ ,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock . 
this is good business for us . 
the potential h@@ itch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting . 
after a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online . 
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites . 
" if you are a tobacco marke@@ ter and you '@@ ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , " said Bec@@ ky Fre@@ eman , a public health researcher at Sy@@ d@@ ney University . 
Fre@@ eman noted an increase in " average Joe " reviews of brands on social media sites such as Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , Twitter and Facebook . 
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigarettes and they '@@ ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ? 
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing . 
the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia . 
a WTO ruling is likely in mid@@ -@@ 2013 . 
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging . 
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 . 
they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine . 
tougher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India . 
many smokers in Australia remain defi@@ ant . 
the pictures don 't affect me . 
I just ignore them . 
" you just grab a smoke and put it away , " said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tum@@ our . 
honestly , there 's only one reason I '@@ d stop , and that 's my little girl . 
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack tob@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sy@@ d@@ ney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to st@@ ack his shelves 
" it used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Y@@ u said . 
" the government should have just banned them altogether and then we '@@ d go OK , fine , we 're done , we 'll shut up shop , " he said , throwing his hands up in the air . 
in a Con@@ stantly P@@ lugg@@ ed@@ -@@ In World , It 's No@@ t All B@@ ad to B@@ e Bo@@ red 
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive . 
so I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom . 
I won 't lie to you . 
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious , even with the distr@@ actions of books , magazines and i@@ P@@ hones ( not to mention du@@ ty@@ -@@ free shopping ) . 
but increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom . 
it 's all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say . 
it forces the brain to go on interesting t@@ ang@@ ents , perhaps fostering creativity . 
and because most of us are almost consistently plugg@@ ed into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom . 
so should we embrace bo@@ re@@ dom ? 
Yes . 
and no . 
but I 'll get back to that . 
first of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time . 
not so , says Peter To@@ o@@ he@@ y , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of " Bo@@ re@@ dom : a Li@@ vely History " ( Y@@ ale University Press , 2011 ) . 
" bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , " he said . 
there 's Latin gr@@ aff@@ iti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ pe@@ i@@ i dating from the first century . 
then there 's the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom . 
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in On@@ tari@@ o , Canada . 
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of " wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . " 
what separates bo@@ re@@ dom from apathy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be . 
with apathy , he said , there is no urge to do something . 
the core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is " disruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . " 
bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an awful lot like depression . 
but Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves . 
sometimes we think we 're bo@@ red when we just have difficulty concentrating . 
in their study , " The un@@ engaged Min@@ d : defining Bo@@ re@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of At@@ tention , " which appeared in the journal Perspectives on P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article . 
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable , while the third group didn 't hear the sound@@ track at all . 
the ones who heard the low@@ -@@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom . 
when you 're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associate professor of neuro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in On@@ tari@@ o and one of the authors of the study . 
on the other hand , when you 're doing something dull , " such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , distr@@ acting music can help you not be bo@@ red . " 
in fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert . 
" research shows that ki@@ ds who are allowed to fid@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said . 
we all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ ron@@ ing speaker , a particularly tedious mo@@ vi@@ e . 
but some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others . 
to help measure this , researchers developed a " Bo@@ re@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness Sc@@ ale " in the 1980s . 
the scale includes questions like , " Many things I have to do are repetitive and mono@@ ton@@ ous , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . " 
using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen V@@ od@@ ano@@ v@@ ich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Flori@@ da , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation . 
but in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ aded lot . 
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper . 
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they we@@ ren 't in school . 
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red . 
professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower . 
but he said he did know that " adolesc@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , " largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do . 
so back to my original question : is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ? 
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows . 
on the other hand , many philosoph@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor V@@ od@@ ano@@ v@@ ich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades . 
" bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said Gary Marc@@ us , a professor of psychology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U@@ . 
but the brain doesn 't always know the most appropriate thing to do . 
if you 're bo@@ red and use that energy to play gu@@ it@@ ar and cook , it will make you happy . 
but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term . 
so if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he ha@@ s@@ n 't learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said . 
and " that self@@ -@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said . 
your kid doesn 't just learn to entertain himself , but gets more self@@ -@@ control in other areas . 
I don 't think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom . 
nor should we be too critical of it . 
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology . 
professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed . 
" we frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an agon@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , " he said . 
what people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time . 
" in an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimulated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise shu@@ ts down . " 
in Col@@ or@@ ado , No P@@ lay@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law 
An@@ th@@ ony Orozco , 19 , a community college student and so@@ cc@@ er player in sou@@ the@@ astern Col@@ or@@ ado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pipe he used to smoke it . 
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the plains near the K@@ ans@@ as border , when they were pulled over . 
after the police officer found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car , Mr. Orozco was issued a summ@@ ons for possession and drug parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - petty off@@ en@@ ses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date . 
" we get treated like criminals , " Mr. Orozco said . 
but is he one ? 
in the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado 's vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location . 
hundreds of misdemean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure . 
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small@@ -@@ scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks . 
but prosecutors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ado have v@@ owed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still citing people for possession . 
at the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state@@ -@@ licensed retail mari@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities . 
" this thing is evolving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of Den@@ ver . 
regulators in Washington State are also scr@@ at@@ ching their heads . 
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licen@@ ses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of De@@ c . 1 , 2013 . 
they say that Col@@ or@@ ado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now rec@@ rea@@ tionally . 
" Col@@ or@@ ado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board . 
but no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work . 
" there 's no real precedent for us to follow , " he said . 
Washington 's law , called I@@ -@@ 5@@ 02 , takes effect on De@@ c . 6 , which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will . 
and there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mandate of " adequate access " to licensed mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1@@ ,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care cent@@ er . 
" nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area , " said Ben Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , a spokesman for the C@@ enter for Legal Cann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group . 
on No@@ v . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e@@ -@@ mail announcing that the city at@@ torney would no longer be prosecuting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes " effective immediately . " 
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers . 
in northern Col@@ or@@ ado 's W@@ eld County , the district at@@ torney , Ken B@@ uck , represents a stricter view . 
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment . 
right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , though many are facing other charges . 
" our office has an obligation to prosecute off@@ en@@ ses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. B@@ uck said in a statement . 
the response has been complicated even in places like rural M@@ esa County , where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initiative . 
the police in Grand Jun@@ c@@ tion , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts . 
the county 's district at@@ torney , Pe@@ te H@@ aut@@ z@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases . 
" I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , " he said . 
although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple . 
and the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence among local officials about the state 's big green experiment . 
" it 's a cultural barrier " with district at@@ tor@@ neys , said S@@ ean Mc@@ Allister , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law@@ s . 
" they spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said . 
as the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization . 
as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes . 
advocates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice Department yields . 
despite some high@@ -@@ profile arrests of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ado , Washington and 16 other states . 
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state@@ -@@ regulated recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana shops allowed under the new laws , said K@@ ev@@ in A. Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration . 
several cities in Col@@ or@@ ado are not waiting for federal authorities to act . 
even before Election Day , some local governments approved moratori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open . 
last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six@@ -@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week . 
" we don 't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , " said Bob Nicholson , a City Council member . 
our community voted against this amendment . 
we 're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for . 
there 's an awful lot of questions . 
Pe@@ tr@@ on@@ ella W@@ y@@ att : I was bullied out of Ox@@ ford for being a Tory 
it is not just today 's university students who are attacked for their views 
I can 't remember a time when I didn 't dream of winning a place at Ox@@ ford University . 
both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I imagined was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a modern@@ -@@ day wine@@ -@@ bl@@ ush@@ ed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance . 
yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Eigh@@ ties to read history , I '@@ d packed my bags , precipit@@ ating the first scandal of my life . 
my father broke down and cri@@ ed . 
friends were baff@@ led . 
the E@@ ven@@ ing Stand@@ ard diary claimed I '@@ d qu@@ it because I objected to fellow under@@ graduates having sex in the room next to mine . 
the writer A N Wil@@ son announced w@@ agg@@ ishly that I '@@ d departed because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs . 
the truth was less dro@@ ll . 
I ran away . 
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation . 
not on account of my rather outr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school . 
I was persecuted for one reason only , and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigo@@ ted and barbaric : my father , the late Wo@@ od@@ row W@@ y@@ att , was a high@@ -@@ profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter . 
why bring this up now , you might ask . 
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution . 
such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Ox@@ ford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al@@ -@@ rights protection as gays , disabled people and ethnic minorities . 
Conservative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Chris@@ ti College 's junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are " often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome " because of their political views . 
they want to create a post on the college 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely . 
their situation was@@ n 't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , W@@ on@@ der@@ land : young , B@@ right and on the Right , about student politics , which portrayed Tories as od@@ d@@ b@@ alls and neo@@ -@@ Nazis . 
it featured graduate Joe Co@@ oke , former president of the Ox@@ ford University Conservative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a R@@ oll@@ s@@ -@@ Roy@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and sil@@ ver@@ -@@ topped cane . 
at other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as " scapegoats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . " 
Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , vic@@ e@@ -@@ president of No@@ tt@@ ingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing Lef@@ t@@ -@@ wing bias at universities . 
people assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . " 
Sam@@ u@@ el Rober@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Chris@@ ti , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " uncomfortable , " while Ste@@ phan@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre . 
" this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says . 
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Ox@@ ford . 
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly shy 18@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old . 
hatred of the Conservative Party was at its most fe@@ br@@ ile . 
the year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding . 
the atmosphere would have made a Stalinist sh@@ ud@@ der with apprehension . 
during the first few days of fresh@@ ers " week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come . 
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only conni@@ ved in the ta@@ unting of Tory under@@ graduates but took part with rel@@ ish . 
the politics of the miners " strike , privatisation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood@@ -@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tu@@ torial . 
my first one involved translating 18@@ th@@ -@@ century French texts into English , and I was unprepared for what followed . 
" Miss W@@ y@@ att , " said the don , Har@@ ry Pit@@ t ( now deceased ) , " please translate the first paragraph . " 
I st@@ umbled over it . 
a small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , Pit@@ t was big on b@@ ile . 
" do That@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? " he demanded . 
the other under@@ graduates gi@@ gg@@ led . 
tears pr@@ icked the back of my eyes . 
" I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you 're not too busy soci@@ alising , " Pit@@ t s@@ nar@@ led . 
I walked back to my rooms a dis@@ cons@@ ol@@ ate figure . 
at dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder . 
it was a second@@ -@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A . 
" I know who you are , " he said kindly . 
I 'm afraid it 's like that . 
anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on . 
it 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you . 
most Tory fresh@@ ers pretend they 're Labour . 
later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate . 
I insisted that I didn 't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said . 
this ploy proved unsuccessful . 
a first year PPE student , who , ironically , had been to E@@ ton , said : " you 're the daughter of a fascist pig . " 
you 're contaminated . 
other students took up the refrain . 
I was per@@ verted , dirty . 
" how do Tories have sex ? " one asked . 
they beat each other , don 't they ? 
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties . 
would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Ox@@ ford ? 
would I be forced to meet like@@ -@@ minded people only after dark ? 
would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ? 
the three years before me stretched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of ostrac@@ ism and isolation . 
the only openly Tory don was Nor@@ man Stone , Professor of Moder@@ n History , who was based at my college . 
he was h@@ ated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers . 
he was hardly ever there . 
he loath@@ ed the place as provincial and petty , and for its adherence to the Marx@@ ist@@ -@@ determin@@ ist view of history . 
in 1997 he took up a prof@@ ess@@ or@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey . 
" you won 't be happy here , " he told me . 
I began commu@@ ting from Ox@@ ford to my parents " house in London , finding refuge with my more open@@ -@@ minded metropolitan friends and family . 
I told my father I h@@ ated Ox@@ ford and why . 
he was inc@@ red@@ ulous . 
during his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted . 
" but it 's the best place in the world , " he said pa@@ thetically . 
they w@@ oul@@ dn 't do that , not among my dreaming sp@@ ires . 
even my Communist friends always had impec@@ cable manners . 
his rhe@@ um@@ y eyes began to cloud . 
give it a chance . 
I 'm sure it 's all just a te@@ ase . 
it would break my heart if you left . 
exhausted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating . 
a male friend of mine , also a Tory supporter , had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed . 
during a tu@@ torial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an " enemy of the people , " I decided to do the same . 
in@@ war@@ dly bl@@ ush@@ ing with shame , I admitted to being " brain@@ washed by my parents " and called them " old fools . " 
the respite was short . 
it was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Ox@@ ford career . 
at the time , he wrote two colum@@ ns in the Mur@@ do@@ ch press each week . 
my door was locked . 
I cow@@ ered inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up . 
when they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London . 
I never went back . 
you may call me a sni@@ velling w@@ im@@ p . 
but no 18@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old should be subject to such intimidation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution . 
even more tragic is that it was Ox@@ ford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hides behind an ill@@ -@@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought . 
" Valent@@ ino prefers eleg@@ ance to notori@@ ety " 
on the occasion of the " Valent@@ ino : Mast@@ er of Cou@@ ture , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , A@@ BC speaks with Nat@@ y A@@ bas@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Thy@@ s@@ sen@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ za and other of the Italian designer 's famous clients . 
Som@@ er@@ set House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valent@@ ino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition . 
during the inauguration of " Valent@@ ino : Mast@@ er of Cou@@ ture , " the designer acknowledged a retrospective apo@@ the@@ osis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture go@@ wns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years . 
" I love this palace " he says , in his unmistakable Italian accent . 
this exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is " sign@@ ore " Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients . 
Valent@@ ino has always been fascinated by the ra@@ re@@ fied and distant world of the no@@ bility . 
in the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aris@@ tocracy , from Pr@@ inc@@ ess Sal@@ im@@ ah Ag@@ a K@@ han , Lord S@@ now@@ don , Pr@@ inc@@ ess Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Margaret of England . 
Valent@@ ino exhi@@ bits these personal memories as if they were trop@@ hies of his social as@@ cent from humble cou@@ tur@@ ier in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ do@@ l of the international jet@@ -@@ set . 
there is nothing wrong with loving roy@@ alty . 
" at least they don 't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some beautiful pop music cele@@ bri@@ ties do , " says Baroness Fi@@ ona Thy@@ s@@ sen@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ za . 
in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 70s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends . 
Valent@@ ino is a spectacular host whose enter@@ tains with generosity and eleg@@ ance . 
" we all loved being invited to his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad " says " He@@ ini " Thyssen 's ex@@ -@@ wife , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as M@@ are@@ lla A@@ gn@@ elli and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ ar@@ cho@@ s . 
Valent@@ ino has always preferred eleg@@ ance to notori@@ ety . 
and yet , he is a star . 
Val@@ er@@ ia Ma@@ zz@@ a , wearing a Valent@@ ino . 
the Argentine model Val@@ er@@ ia Ma@@ zz@@ a also recalls the cou@@ tur@@ ier 's char@@ isma . 
many years ago , after a fashion show in Pi@@ az@@ za di Sp@@ ag@@ na in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat . 
there were twenty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy J@@ r . 
you could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its dec@@ or , the food and the music . 
" all the guests were made to feel important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture Week Paris , in 1995 . 
" his designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she concludes . 
no@@ bility parade 
Gar@@ av@@ ani 's life is not a story of obsession , but of well reciproc@@ ated love . 
he lo@@ ves well@@ -@@ educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him . 
one of the Som@@ er@@ set House galleries has been transformed into a g@@ lam@@ or@@ ous , six@@ ty@@ -@@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role reversal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream " audience " wearing Valent@@ ino master@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jack@@ ie Kennedy chose for her w@@ edding with Aristotle On@@ ass@@ is , the co@@ stu@@ me Monica Vit@@ ti wor@@ e in " La No@@ tte " and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ ba . 
in this crowd of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ bil@@ la of Luxembourg , Gl@@ oria von Th@@ ur@@ n un@@ d Ta@@ xis , Met@@ te@@ -@@ Mar@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ ario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg . 
Nat@@ y A@@ bas@@ cal and the designer , in 2006 
many of these clients say your first Valent@@ ino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . " 
I remember it perfectly . 
it was a pair of trous@@ ers , a shir@@ t , a " g@@ il@@ et " wa@@ ist@@ coat and jacket from the 197@@ 1@@ -@@ 1972 aut@@ um@@ n@@ -@@ winter collection . 
" it was a gift he gave me " says Nat@@ y A@@ bas@@ cal , one of the designer 's m@@ uses . 
" I prefer him to other design@@ ers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty " added the former Duc@@ h@@ ess of Fer@@ ia . 
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your face . 
their proportions are perfect . 
the pr@@ inc@@ ess and fashion advisor Patricia d@@ ella Giov@@ am@@ pa@@ ola d 'A@@ ren@@ berg also remembers the first time she wor@@ e a Valent@@ ino . 
as a teen@@ ager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I '@@ d have the chance to wear one of his evening go@@ wns ... 
my time finally came in the late ' 90s . 
I bought my first Valent@@ ino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cous@@ in , Prince Ed@@ ou@@ ard de Li@@ gne . 
it was a red dress , with a fr@@ illy skir@@ t , d@@ raped " cor@@ s@@ age " and a str@@ ap@@ less nec@@ k@@ line . 
" it was a dream come true " says Pr@@ inc@@ ess D 'A@@ ren@@ berg , the wi@@ dow of Ro@@ dri@@ go d 'A@@ ren@@ berg . 
" Valent@@ ino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is tim@@ eless " says this Italian aris@@ to@@ crat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires . 
Pr@@ inc@@ ess D 'A@@ ren@@ berg looks after her cou@@ tur@@ ier go@@ wns with " the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many memories that go with it . " 
the " king " of fashion 
the " grand fin@@ ale " of the Som@@ er@@ set House exhibition is Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al Miller 's w@@ edding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 . 
it took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ v@@ or@@ y@@ -@@ coloured sil@@ k go@@ wn with twelve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long . 
according to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the return of high society clients . " 
d@@ az@@ z@@ led for years with the " sa@@ vo@@ ir@@ -@@ être " of the elite , Valent@@ ino is now its finest expon@@ ent . 
Cav@@ ali@@ ere di Gr@@ an Cro@@ ce ( the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cav@@ ali@@ ere del L@@ av@@ or@@ o , Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur de L '@@ Or@@ d@@ re des Ar@@ ts et des Le@@ tt@@ res , and awarded the Leg@@ ion of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accumul@@ ates as many honours as any of his clients ' husbands . 
" I '@@ ve always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his ne@@ at and perfect appearance " acknowledges D 'A@@ ren@@ berg . 
the last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum . 
he was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jacqu@@ eline de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine . 
" he was im@@ mac@@ ulate , time stands still for him . " 
if a pr@@ inc@@ ess says that ... 
the hardest job in the world : the human m@@ ules of K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en 
for four euros , the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths . 
there are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell . 
this is the case of An@@ to Wij@@ aya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcano , east of the Indonesian island of J@@ ava . 
to do so , he has to descend every day to the bottom of the cr@@ ater , where the sulph@@ ur@@ ous gas emanating from the b@@ ow@@ els of the earth soli@@ di@@ fies on contact with air . 
after breaking off large sulphur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos , he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ kets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths . 
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2@@ ,@@ 3@@ 86 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at snail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the preci@@ p@@ ice . 
they know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ ffs . 
the K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed . 
once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus mon@@ keys and then , lu@@ gging their heavy bas@@ kets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 850 metres above sea level . 
this is PT N@@ gri@@ m@@ bi C@@ andi , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur . 
it then sells the sulphur for 10@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 cents ) to the petro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fireworks , cosmetics , dynam@@ ite and even for whit@@ ening sugar . 
" we generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.8 euros ) a trip " explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day . 
each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 138@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day . 
although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field . 
" miners ' wages are very high here , whereas coffee harvesting is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 167 euros ) " explains the porter , who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of Bali . 
there , his wage was 7@@ 5@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ w@@ ang@@ i , a village near the volcano , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as overriding as the sulphur : " I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I '@@ ve brought her to J@@ ava to convert to Islam . " 
An@@ to has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases . 
at 27 years old , An@@ to has been risking his life for three years in the K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and go@@ gg@@ les . 
he has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano . 
this is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams . 
" I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he v@@ ows in more than acceptable English . 
punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ it@@ er or hotel recep@@ tionist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le . 
sharing a fil@@ thy wooden hu@@ t with other porters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn 't stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dark . 
def@@ ying the shadows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the cr@@ ater and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the hel@@ met he bought with his money . 
some 400 porters carry sulphur bas@@ kets on their shoulders from the cr@@ ater . 
despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechanis@@ ed the sulphur extraction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kilo . 
in fact , they do not even see any of the 3@@ 0,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 2.5 euro ) per camera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human m@@ ules . 
" this work is for animals , not people " protests Mad@@ rus@@ in , a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year porter who has been working at K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades , since leaving school . 
he can lift up to 110 kilos , ensuring that he will go on working " all he can " because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old . 
I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life . 
although the sulphur burns your throat and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick colum@@ ns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so har@@ dy that no@@ -@@ one complains of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ thri@@ tis , knee pain and so@@ res on the shoulders , which have been mis@@ shap@@ en by the weight of the bas@@ kets . 
balancing the basket on his back , Un@@ ain@@ ik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old . 
every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano , which three lorries move to the ware@@ house in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scru@@ bland . 
" I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life " says Un@@ ain@@ ik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be . 
the oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sulphur . 
time passes , but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world : the one done by human m@@ ules in the K@@ awa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcano . 
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy 
Sing@@ apo@@ reans blame their careers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children . 
" Singapore 's population needs to grow . " 
I 'm a patriotic husband , you 're my patriotic wife , let 's do our civic duty and create life ! 
it may seem unlikely that these vers@@ es are part of an adver@@ t for min@@ t sweets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be in Singapore earlier this year . 
the phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " Let 's put a bao ( bu@@ n ) in the o@@ ven " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore . 
the advertising company that made the video , B@@ B@@ H , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way . 
its creative director , Dou@@ glas Ham@@ il@@ ton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . " 
it 's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and amusing . 
it 's the biggest problem facing this country . 
we are the world 's worst at reproducing our own prog@@ en@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address . 
we knew the Government had tried many things , like launching per@@ fumes with ph@@ er@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings . 
many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn 't necessarily work . 
so we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by com@@ posing a rap ? 
1.2 children 
but the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly . 
it spends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children . 
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15@@ ,000 per child , extends maternity leave and distribu@@ tes tax benefits . 
but this has all had little effect . 
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls . 
the birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman . 
the last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 . 
so why are Sing@@ apo@@ reans not having children ? 
T@@ an Wei M@@ ing , Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Family Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . " 
" this has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains . 
these changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore . 
meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population . 
in Singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating . 
increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence . 
since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers . 
unexpected consequences 
while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences . 
the Government is trying not to build so many small houses . 
for example , it has started to influence the real estate sector . 
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apar@@ tments , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city . 
these apar@@ tments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales . 
however , there is concern that they may promote a sing@@ le@@ -@@ living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses . 
but , Li@@ m Y@@ ew So@@ on , managing director of the real estate company EL Develop@@ ers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units . 
they are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units . 
this means they are much better for our cash flow . 
however , he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project . 
too stressed 
Singapore is a city State . 
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apo@@ reans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact . 
" people are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive . 
other people can have children . 
" but , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old . 
men and women alike mention their careers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children . 
so , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Sing@@ apo@@ reans have the last word . 
what is private off@@ line is private online 
privacy . 
according to the Spanish Royal Academy D@@ ic@@ tionary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . " 
what is privacy for an under 16 ? 
how do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ? 
do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share off@@ line ? 
el@@ Per@@ i@@ ó@@ dic@@ o interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users . 
in four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and pass@@ word " when applied to social networks . 
" I w@@ oul@@ dn 't up@@ load my deepest secrets in a post " says J@@ or@@ ge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Ho@@ t@@ mail and W@@ ind@@ ows Li@@ ve Mess@@ enger , with which he has had accounts for two years . 
" they are very secret secrets , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says . 
on F@@ B I up@@ load nice pictures or games . 
and I have fun with people I know . 
" I w@@ oul@@ dn 't share a photo that isn 't mine , or that belongs to somebody who 's doing something stupid " he says . 
the child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments . 
J@@ or@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine followers on Twitter . 
most are relatives . 
his mother is included , and she has the pass@@ word to one of the accounts . 
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting twe@@ ets . 
" I don 't know if they answer me , I only up@@ load them " he adds . 
" social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says . 
he does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person . 
nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him . 
the case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different . 
this teen@@ ager has accounts with Ho@@ t@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and As@@ k , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list . 
" it doesn 't bother me , because we have something in common , like music " he says . 
the boy says that no@@ -@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number . 
" if they pres@@ sured me or asked me for it , I '@@ d just delete them from my account " he states . 
Joseph became a follow@@ er on As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on Twitter . 
this teen@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyber@@ bullying . 
an acquain@@ tance of a friend of mine was being pe@@ stered on a social network . 
they were threatening him and demanding money from him . 
" I never found out who it was " he says . 
the victim , according to José , did not close his account . 
" he just made it private . " 
he then explains a series of steps to confi@@ g@@ ure the account safely . 
unlike J@@ or@@ ge , this boy would up@@ load photos of acquain@@ tances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations . 
I would do it if I didn 't like somebody , or they made me want to do it . 
" however , I know that 's cyber@@ bullying " he admits . 
key questions 
Mari@@ el@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform . 
" the Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed " he says . 
Por@@ ras says the schol@@ ar Marc P@@ ren@@ sky , with a Mast@@ er 's degree in Education from Y@@ ale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Im@@ migrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon . 
digital na@@ tives are those children and young people born with technology . 
" we are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says . 
he says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . " 
" they also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he adds . 
according to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think . 
" telling them not to do it is no good " he adds . 
Por@@ ras then lists some options : there are things you w@@ oul@@ dn 't tell a stranger , so why do it online ? 
or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ? 
do you know what others publish about you ? 
when tagging party photos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ? 
and one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ? 
another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do off@@ line . 
the rules are the same . 
" outside the Internet , people act with respect , morality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says . 
monitoring 
Stu@@ art Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thoroughly . 
by understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account . 
" for example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says . 
according to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the " don 't talk to strangers " lesson . 
U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration 
the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ a@@ sur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration , previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders . 
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and Chanc@@ ell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website . 
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press . 
journalists ' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times . 
during the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audio restricted . " 
the little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peruvian Government . 
the only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details . 
the Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit . 
last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South Americ@@ an@@ -@@ Arab Countries ( AS@@ PA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public . 
the AS@@ PA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday . 
at both international events , the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum . 
the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to ad@@ judic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries . 
the Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Se@@ bas@@ ti@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the law@@ suit Lima has filed against Santiago . 
" we will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court " said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chilean counterpart . 
" Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts " added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , greeting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ shake , alongside the flags of the two countries . 
confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogo@@ t@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed . 
the summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Cha@@ vez ; Bolivia , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Argentina , Cris@@ tina Kir@@ chner . 
Paraguay , which was suspended by U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting . 
host President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lima . 
the President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments . 
among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . " 
he reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime , actions to make medication more accessible , low@@ -@@ cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . " 
with Europe in crisis , " economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a triumph@@ alist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matri@@ x and glimpse a better future for its people " Hum@@ ala added . 
" we decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Peruvian President in a message read out . 
among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse axes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details . 
also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay . 
" we hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded . 
the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbourly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit . 
in this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in Mexico , to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bogo@@ ta . 
" the day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega " Santos said . 
" we will review all these paths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua " he emphasised . 
" with President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible " said Santos . 
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country 's new President , Enrique Pe@@ ñ@@ a Nie@@ to . 
also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region . 
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Paraguay make up U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended . 
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional bloc . 
" South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Raf@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea 
the President of Ecuador , Raf@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . " 
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the E@@ le@@ vent@@ h Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR ) held in Lima , told Peru 's state television that Europeans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now practically one country . " 
to this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR . 
" we have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community . however , there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said . 
the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights . 
those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything . 
" it is incomprehensible that the Inter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Juli@@ an Assange . 
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . " 
he added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected . " 
additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via video@@ conference , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Embassy in London . " 
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange 's physical and mental health . 
" I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President . 
what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any out@@ door exercise . 
" that would complicate the health of any person " he added . 
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Embassy , in London , through the issue of a safe@@ -@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder . 
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions . 
" the solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Assange 's lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said . 
and he felt that " if Britain says no to the safe@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . " 
and if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or interrog@@ ates him via Sky@@ pe tomorrow , this problem is over . 
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is " the medi@@ ocr@@ ity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . " 
" the greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , blackmail and extortion " he said . 
in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the bankers or bourgeois and hegem@@ onic countries that dominate Ecuador " and said that , if re@@ -@@ elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . " 
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup m@@ asked with legality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitimacy of Paragu@@ ay@@ an democracy . " 
the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President also considered the " perfectly pertinent " desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nicar@@ agu@@ an maritime sovereignty . 
for now that ruling is not being followed . 
it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one . 
conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together . 
they need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward . 
additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . " 
with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . " 
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will retire from public life . 
personally , I '@@ ve never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , socio@@ -@@ economic poverty can only be corrected by political power . 
" my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said . 
if I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life . 
if I lose , likewise . 
" it 's a decision " he confirmed . 
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Cha@@ vez 's new health treatment in Cuba . 
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba . 
" this does not mean a health rel@@ ap@@ se for President Cha@@ vez " he said . 
in Lima today , the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security . 
deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection 
Fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive . 
" it was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " softer , " apparently un@@ successfully . 
the boy hid it from his family . 
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 4@@ 3rd birthday . 
he is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil Ho@@ sp@@ ital ( C@@ H@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health . 
Fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io has lived with the human immu@@ no@@ deficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stigma . 
then , even the director of an IM@@ SS [ Mexican Social Security Institute ] clin@@ ic refused to discharge him " because he had a cut . " 
at that time , having Aids was synonymous with death . 
now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life . 
however , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , " exhausted " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections . 
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the C@@ H@@ G HIV Unit , J@@ aim@@ e Andr@@ ade Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal . 
infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , Andr@@ ade Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non@@ -@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count . 
in simple terms , this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e . 
to gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mex@@ icans today is 76 years . 
although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4@@ ,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( U@@ NA@@ I@@ DS annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died . 
in J@@ alis@@ co alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retroviral drugs since 2005 . 
- Why are do still deaths occur ? 
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment . 
that 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital . 
for at least the last 12 years we '@@ ve had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease . 
he gave a compelling statistic : " nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . " 
specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in J@@ alis@@ co ( CO@@ ES@@ IDA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ pos@@ i sar@@ com@@ a , a canc@@ erous tum@@ our that is one of the common complications . 
everything changes when you know you have AIDS . 
some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything . 
" if I 'm going to die , I '@@ d rather have a blow@@ -@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case . 
the change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs . 
to date , his parents are only aware he had cancer . 
I live as normal a life as anyone else . 
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said Fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with M@@ IL@@ EN@@ I@@ O J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid . 
they should get tested if they are at ris@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible . 
this is his message , which summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 . 
condoms behind the counter . 
the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ az@@ ar , a journalist from Guad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause . 
and the greatest cure is prevention . 
in places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said . 
among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers . 
" why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with s@@ arc@@ as@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ sel@@ l@@ ors , pharm@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker . 
it was decided to change such inefficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind coun@@ ters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toil@@ et dispens@@ ers in places frequ@@ ented by young people . 
this is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity . 
it is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ tel fees , as Governor E@@ mili@@ o Gonz@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration . 
" and it 's not about sexuality , but it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity " he said . 
J@@ alis@@ co key points 
there are 13@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 cumulative cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 158 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) . 
the state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV . 
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 % via the blood@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ at@@ al . 
an estimated 5@@ 0,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4@@ -@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive . 
ratified by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems . 
it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions . 
in practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern Dis@@ tric@@ t of Texas , leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico . 
however , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three inconsistencies . 
from the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Code , the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Cir@@ cu@@ it , based in New Or@@ leans , states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico . 
the first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles . 
indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitr@@ ator . 
secondly , the judgement establishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved . 
however , Mexican law recognises the possibility . 
in fact , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted . 
there are half a dozen examples , including Agre@@ me@@ x and Commercial Mex@@ ic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Institute . 
what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro creditors who fought against it in the US courts , namely " vul@@ ture " funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capital , Au@@ reli@@ os Convergence , El@@ li@@ ot International and Liverpool Lim@@ ited , did not achieve a majority . 
the vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 . 
this data is omitted by the Court of Appeal . 
from another perspective , the latter bl@@ ames Vit@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country . 
for now , the Gonz@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously . 
should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed . 
the real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amic@@ us curi@@ ae ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Commercial In@@ solvency Law , noting that the latter discharged itself with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States . 
moreover , it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross@@ -@@ border insolvency cases , ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors . 
double w@@ ham@@ my : vitro hit and country hit . 
balance She@@ et 
with the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ ic@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , G@@ ast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ r@@ aga Andr@@ ade , who is accused of mismanagement , dormant for several months , the Air@@ line Pil@@ ots Union Association already found the bottleneck . 
the proceedings headed by Carlos Di@@ az Cha@@ vez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstructing justice . 
the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the At@@ torney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 19@@ 8 million pes@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of B@@ anc@@ o I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mex@@ ic@@ ana de Avi@@ aci@@ ón . 
the resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Adminis@@ trad@@ ora Pro@@ fe@@ sional de Ho@@ tel@@ es . 
as you know , Az@@ carr@@ aga Andr@@ ade is the main shareholder of the Pos@@ ad@@ as hotel chain . 
opposing Dr@@ agon Mar@@ t 
a group of local and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dr@@ agon Mar@@ t in Cancun . 
as you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies . 
previously , CA@@ N@@ AC@@ IN@@ TR@@ A had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry . 
the death of ACTA 
the Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the An@@ ti@@ -@@ Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , known by its acron@@ ym ACTA , according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archi@@ ved . 
as you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , deem@@ ing it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks . 
H@@ ome@@ x long term 
in effort to repay long@@ -@@ term debt without affecting short@@ -@@ term debt , the housing develop@@ er H@@ ome@@ x is placing securities exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pes@@ os .

a consortium under the name Competi@@ val has just been established , comprising the companies N@@ Y@@ CE , E@@ -@@ Quality and Ker@@ net , leaders in information technology , the objective of which will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America . 
investments in this area exceed USD 1.5 billion . 
Hec@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes : " bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life " 
bas@@ ket@@ ball glo@@ be@@ tro@@ tter Hec@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world . 
few people in Puer@@ to R@@ ico have a mental recol@@ lection of local bas@@ ket@@ ball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor " He@@ tin " Re@@ yes . 
Re@@ yes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Su@@ peri@@ or Bas@@ ket@@ ball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ket@@ ball Federation . 
" I wor@@ e lots of hats in bas@@ ket@@ ball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Te@@ am during the ' 90s , " recalled Re@@ yes during Pri@@ mer@@ a H@@ ora 's visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isa@@ bel , his loyal wife for over 50 years . 
" bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life . " 
Re@@ yes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement . 
the walls of his house are almost totally dec@@ or@@ ated with pictures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long career , which goes to prove it . 
Bay@@ am@@ ón at heart 
of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os , from the mid@@ -@@ 5@@ 0s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co@@ -@@ agent or agent of the franchise . 
" those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co@@ -@@ agent or manager . 
there were many good years , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 . 
and then I said goodbye with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome Min@@ cy 's de@@ but year in the B@@ S@@ N . 
then " C@@ uc@@ o " Or@@ ti@@ z took over - he was a great manager " said Re@@ yes . 
I remember that Gen@@ e Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of A@@ lab@@ ama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I '@@ ve got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " tall . 
do you want him ? ' 
and that was the beginning of Min@@ cy , one of the best players Puer@@ to R@@ ico ever had . 
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the shar@@ p@@ sho@@ o@@ ter G@@ aus@@ se Ray@@ mond , who established residency here and was one of our best sho@@ o@@ ters . 
I remember him saying that if Min@@ cy had given Bay@@ am@@ on one championship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another . 
the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os ' championship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative bi@@ g@@ shot . 
for that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and Min@@ cy 's accompl@@ ishments in the national team . 
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre@@ -@@ Olympics in Mexico . 
then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bron@@ ze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Re@@ yes . 
is the 1990 World National Te@@ am the best you '@@ ve ever seen ? 
it 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the D@@ re@@ am Te@@ am in the 2004 Olympics . 
however , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won bron@@ ze at the World Cup . 
that team not only again included Min@@ cy , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ v@@ as , F@@ ico López and ' P@@ icul@@ ín ' ( Or@@ ti@@ z ) , but also the young ( Javier ) ' To@@ ñ@@ i@@ to ' Col@@ ón and James C@@ arter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Ed@@ gar ) and Mario ' Qu@@ i@@ jo@@ te ' Mor@@ ales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury . 
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold med@@ al and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre@@ -@@ Olympic team in Ne@@ u@@ qu@@ en , Argentina . 
with role players such as ' Can@@ i@@ to ' Ni@@ eves , P@@ abl@@ o A@@ lic@@ ea and the young R@@ ol@@ an@@ do H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ in@@ er replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the M@@ ar del Plat@@ a Pan@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the odds . 
who was the best Puer@@ to R@@ ican player ? 
without any doubt , P@@ icul@@ ín Or@@ ti@@ z . 
his numbers at international tour@@ nam@@ ent level are aw@@ esome . 
nobody in Puer@@ to R@@ ico has dominated at that level like P@@ icul@@ ín did . 
not to mention his career in the various le@@ agues he played in . 
who was the best Puer@@ to R@@ ican manager ? 
that 's a difficult one . 
we had a very good team , including Juli@@ o Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ ende@@ z , Carlos Mor@@ ales , Ray@@ mond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Torres . 
of the youngsters , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ar@@ ill . 
what do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ? 
having been part of the National Te@@ am 's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season . 
what was there left for you to do ? 
there were things I '@@ d have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor le@@ agues . 
for example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national pla@@ yo@@ ffs . 
right now the ki@@ ds are riding and playing too much , unnecessarily . 
at least I see the fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refe@@ rees . 
that pleases me . 
what are you doing now ? 
the most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to bas@@ ket@@ ball games . 
and of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .

" he was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gr@@ ay in a statement . 
H@@ ag@@ man was diagnosed with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years . 
in 1995 a m@@ align@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant . 
years before " Dall@@ as , " H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light com@@ edy " I D@@ re@@ am of Je@@ anni@@ e , " aired on N@@ BC from 1965 to 1970 . 
he played Captain Tony Nelson , an astr@@ onau@@ t whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Barbara E@@ den , and takes her home to live with him . 
he also star@@ red in two sit@@ com@@ s that were not aired for long , " The Good Life " ( N@@ BC , 197@@ 1@@ -@@ 72 ) and " H@@ ere We G@@ o Ag@@ ain " ( A@@ BC , 1973 ) . 
his film work included roles well received by critics in " The Group , " " Har@@ ry and T@@ onto " and " Pri@@ m@@ ary Col@@ ors . " 
but it was his master@@ ful interpretation of deligh@@ tfully de@@ testable J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom . 
the drama series on C@@ B@@ S about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991 . 
the t@@ ag@@ line " Wh@@ o shot J@@ R ? , " designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which H@@ ag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establishments . 
it also helped give the series a record audience at the time . 
when the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made " Dall@@ as " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " M@@ AS@@ H " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers . 
it was J@@ R 's s@@ is@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who shot him . 
J@@ r got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitu@@ te unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him . 
H@@ ag@@ man portrayed Ewing as a corrupt in@@ sati@@ able man with a char@@ is@@ matic smile : a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife , S@@ ue El@@ len ( Lind@@ a Gr@@ ay ) , sec@@ tioned . 
" I know what I want on J@@ R 's tom@@ b@@ stone " H@@ ag@@ man said in 1988 . 
it should read : " here lies the honest citizen J@@ R Ewing . " 
this is the only deal he lost . 
Vic@@ toria Princi@@ p@@ al , co@@ -@@ star of the original series , recalled H@@ ag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . " 
he is un@@ forge@@ t@@ table and irreplaceable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him . 
ten episodes of the new edition of " Dall@@ as " were broadcast a few months ago with great success for T@@ NT . 
he had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported . 
immediately after , there was no statement from War@@ ner or T@@ NT about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man . 
H@@ ag@@ man , born in For@@ t Wor@@ th , Texas , was the son of ac@@ tress and s@@ inger Mary Martin , who star@@ red in classi@@ cs such as " South Pacific " and " Peter Pan . " 
Martin was still a teen@@ ager when she had him in 19@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben H@@ ag@@ man . 
he tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early ' 5@@ 0s , and later served in the Air Force from 195@@ 2 to 1956 , in England . 
while there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ el@@ sson and married her . 
the couple had two sons , P@@ rest@@ on and Hei@@ di , and lived for a long time in the Califor@@ nian city M@@ ali@@ bu , home to many cele@@ bri@@ ties . 
in 2001 , he called his mem@@ o@@ irs " H@@ ello Dar@@ lin ' : tall ( and Ab@@ solu@@ tely Tr@@ ue ) T@@ ales Ab@@ out My Life . " 
" I didn 't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associ@@ ated Press at the time . 
after his liver transplant , he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fearful patients . 
" I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards " he said in 1996 . 
I try to offer some comfort , such as " Don 't be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . " 
he was also an anti@@ -@@ smoking activist and took part in several campaigns . 
start of a course that explo@@ res the " En@@ d of the World " 
each week , students explore apocaly@@ ptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming . 
this term , when Professor of religion , Stu@@ art ch@@ arm@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : the end of the " long coun@@ tdown " of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming . 
but ch@@ arm@@ é had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : the cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic hurricane San@@ dy , a fiscal preci@@ p@@ ice some called " debt Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ world Christians the@@ or@@ ists think the A@@ poc@@ aly@@ pse will begin . 
" I didn 't realise this was going to be the most apocaly@@ ptic term ever " said ch@@ arm@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jer@@ sey ) . 
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period . 
and remember that bad is good for those with an apocaly@@ ptic mentality . 
and he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theoretically the last in history . 
at Temp@@ le , Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry V@@ ack@@ er is giving the course " Media , Culture and the end of the world . " 
each week , students explore apocaly@@ ptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming . 
" we looked at why these ideas proliferate over time " he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour . 
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out . 
this month students analysed mo@@ vies with an apocaly@@ ptic theme and explored how they compare with real@@ -@@ life examples . 
" I '@@ ve tried to inform students about what is possible , probable , credible and impossible " said V@@ ack@@ er . 
at the main Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania State University camp@@ us , Latin American History Professor Matthe@@ w R@@ est@@ all , and his colleague A@@ mar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Ar@@ t History and An@@ thro@@ po@@ logy Professor , have te@@ amed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . " 
" we don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn 't come to an end " said R@@ est@@ all . 
despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , undertake projects and take final exams . 
at Pen@@ n State , the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the A@@ poc@@ aly@@ pse , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said R@@ est@@ all . 
the courses proved quite popular . 
" it was fully booked within two hours " said R@@ est@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students . 
we received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places . 
students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around . 
" I find it fascinating to see what people do to con@@ sole themselves " said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Robinson , a 23@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ graduate Re@@ ligion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ add@@ on@@ field , New Jer@@ sey , at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den . 
and the apocaly@@ ptic , secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it . 
will We@@ kes@@ a , a 25@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ graduate P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy and N@@ ur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apocaly@@ ptic mo@@ vies . 
" I '@@ d never heard of a class that could teach it " he said . 
I enjoy it . 
but none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st . 
" our first project was about the May@@ an prophec@@ y and to a certain extent we discredited it " said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 21@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old final year student at Temp@@ le , from West C@@ hester . 
the May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said R@@ est@@ all . 
but he said that Western culture suffers from apocaly@@ ptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world . 
the Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations . 
" in other places , people don 't think about it " he said . 
it 's mostly in the Engl@@ ish@@ -@@ speaking world . 
Joseph D@@ ough@@ er@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La Sal@@ le University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there . 
" the Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority . 
we have an indulgence from the Pope . 
R@@ est@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or philosop@@ his@@ ing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven@@ -@@ year period after which the world will end . 
students and teachers are taking the date lightly . 
some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties . 
" maybe I 'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old communications student .
